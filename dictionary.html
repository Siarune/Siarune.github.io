            <div id="dorble">Dorble is a medeival word that is rarely even known today, but means little. It just means 'idiot', or more accurately, a dolt. I wouldn't reccomend calling someono this, though, as "you're a dorble" sounds like "you're adorable". But I had to tell you anyway.</div>
            <br>
            <div id="argle">Argle-bargle: basically a lot of meaningless talk or writing- just like this website.</div>
            <br>
            <div id="doodle">Okay, so I know how this sounds, but 'doodle sack' is an old English word for bagpipe. I laughed way too much when I found out.</div>
