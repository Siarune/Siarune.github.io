            <h2>Jack and Randy</h2>
            
            <p class="words">
            Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
            so Jack could lick her candy.<br>
            But Jack got a shock<br>
            and a mouthful of cock<br>
            'cause Jill's middle name is Randy

            <h2>Jack and Jill and Marijuana</h2>
            
            <p class="words">
               Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
               to smoke some marijuana.<br>
                <br>
               Jack got high and grabbed her thigh<br>
               and said "you know you wanna".<br>
                <br>
                Jill said yes and pulled up her dress<br>
                and then they had some fun.<br>
                <br>
                But silly Jill forgot her pill<br>
                and now they have a son.
