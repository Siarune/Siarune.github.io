            Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
            so Jack could lick her candy.<br>
            But Jack got a shock<br>
            and a mouthful of cock<br>
            'cause Jill's middle name is Randy

            <p class="words">
               Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
               to smoke some marijuana.<br>
                <br>
               Jack got high and grabbed her thigh<br>
               and said "you know you wanna".<br>
                <br>
                Jill said yes and pulled up her dress<br>
                and then they had some fun.<br>
                <br>
                But silly Jill forgot her pill<br>
                and now they have a son.

            <h2>Grandpa Got Shot Down by a Muslim</h2>
            <h3>not a poem, but parodies are close enough</h3>
            
            <p class="words">
                Grandpa got shot down by a muslim<br>
                Coming home from Iran Christmas Eve<br>
                Mom really thought that he would make it,<br>
                But as for me and Dad, we just grieve.<br>
                <br>
                Gonna have the funeral late this Wednesday.<br>
                Carry down the coffin half-past three.<br>
                Soldiers do the flag and gun salute thing,<br>
                Too bad Mom got shot in the knee.<br>
                <br>
                Oh~ Grandpa got shot down by a muslim<br>
                And Mom went back to drinking every night.<br>
                Dad said she just needed time for mourning,<br>
                If only I hadn't left her with a knife.<br>
                <br>
                So~ Grandpa got shot down by a muslim,<br>
                And Mom just committed suicide.<br>
                Dad says that he'll be alright<br>
                I just really hope he doesn't choose to die.<br>
