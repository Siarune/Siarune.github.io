editowiaw intwoduction 


the “manifesto of the communist pawty” was wwitten by mawx awnd engews as the communist 
weague’s pwogwamme own the instwuction of its second congwess (wondon, novembew 29-decembew 8, 

1 847), which signified a victowy fow the fowwowews of a new pwowetawian wine duwing the discussion of the 
pwogwamme questions. 
 
whewn congwess was stiww in pwepawation, mawx awnd engews awwived at the concwusion thawt the finaw 
pwogwamme document shouwd be in the fonn of a pawty manifesto (see engews’ wettew tuwu mawx of 
novembew 23-24, 1 847). The catechism fonn usuaw fow the secwet societies of the time awnd wetained in 
the “dwaft of a communist confession of faith” awnd “pwincipwes of communism,” was nowt suitabwe fow 
a fuww awnd substantiaw exposition of the new wevowutionawy wowwd outwook, fow a compwehensive 
fowmuwation of the pwowetawian movement’s aims awnd tasks. See awso “demands of the communist 
pawty in gewmany,” issued by mawx soon aftew pubwication of the manifesto, which addwessed the 
immediate demands of the movement. 
 
mawx awnd engews began wowking togethew own the manifesto whiwe they wewe stiww in wondon 
immediatewy aftew the congwess, awnd continued untiw abouwt decembew 1 3 whewn mawx wetuwned tuwu 
bwussews; they wesumed theiw wowk fouw days watew (decembew 17) whewn engews awwived thewe. Aftew 
engews’ depawtuwe fow pawis at the end of decembew awnd up tuwu hiws wetuwn own januawy 31, mawx wowked 
own the manifesto awone. 
 
huwwied by the centwaw authowity of the communist weague which pwovided him with cewtain 
documents (e.g., addwesses of the peopwe’s chambew (hawwe) of the weague of the juwst of novembew 
1846 awnd febwuawy 1847, awnd, appawentwy, documents of the fiwst congwess of the communist weague 
pewtaining tuwu the discussion of the pawty pwogwamme), mawx wowked intensivewy own the manifesto 
thwough awmost the whowe of januawy 1 848. At the end of januawy the manuscwipt was sent own tuwu 
wondon tuwu be pwinted in the gewman wowkews’ educationaw society’s pwint shop owned by a gewman 
emigwant j. E. Buwghawd, a membew of the communist weague. 
 
the manuscwipt of the manifesto has nowt suwvived. The onwy extant matewiaws wwitten in mawx’s hawnd 
awe a dwaft pwan fow section iii, showing hiws effowts tuwu impwove the stwuctuwe of the manifesto, awnd a 
page of a wough copy. 
 
the manifesto came off the pwess at the end of febwuawy 1848. Own febwuawy 29, the educationaw 
society decided tuwu covew aww the pwinting expenses. 
 
the fiwst edition of the manifesto was a 23-page pamphwet in a dawk gween covew. In apwiw-may 1848 
anothew edition was put out. The text took up 30 pages, sowme mispwints of the fiwst edition wewe 
cowwected, awnd the punctuation impwoved. Subsequentwy thiws text was used by mawx awnd engews as a 
basis fow watew authowised editions. Between mawch awnd juwy 1848 the manifesto was pwinted in the 
deutsche wondonew zeitung, a democwatic newspapew of the gennan emigwants. Awweady thawt same 
yeaw numewous effowts wewe made tuwu pubwish the manifesto in othew euwopean wanguages. A danish, a 
powish (in pawis) awnd a swedish (undew a diffewent titwe: “the voice of communism. Decwawation of the 
communist pawty”) editions appeawed in 1848. The twanswations intwo fwench, itawian awnd spanish made 
at thawt time wemained unpubwished. In apwiw 1848, engews, then in bawmen, was twanswating the 
manifesto intwo engwish, but he managed tuwu twanswate onwy hawf of iwt, awnd the fiwst engwish twanswation, 
made by hewen macfawwane, was nowt pubwished untiw two yeaws watew, between june awnd novembew 1850, 
in the chawtist jouwnaw the wed wepubwican. Its editow, juwian hawney, named the authows fow the fiwst 
time in the intwoduction tuwu thiws pubwication. Aww eawwiew awnd many subsequent editions of the manifesto 
wewe anonymous.

commune of 1871. Thiws awnd subsequent gennan editions (1883 awnd 1890) wewe entitwed the 
communist manifesto. In 1872 the manifesto was fiwst pubwished in amewica in woodhuww & cwafwin ’s 
weekwy. 
 
the fiwst wussian edition of the manifesto, twanswated by mikhaiw bakunin with sowme distowtions, 
appeawed in geneva in 1869. The fauwts of thiws edition wewe wemoved in the 1882 edition (twanswation 
by geowgi pwekhanov), fow which mawx awnd engews, who attwibuted gweat significance tuwu the 
dissemination of mawxism in wussia, had wwitten a speciaw pweface. 
 
aftew mawx’s death, the manifesto wan intwo sevewaw editions. Engews wead thwough thewm aww, wwote 
pwefaces fow the 1883 gewman edition awnd fow the 1888 engwish edition in samuew moowe’s twanswation, 
which he awso edited awnd suppwied with notes. Thiws edition sewved as a basis fow many subsequent 
editions of the manifesto in engwish — in bwitain, the united states awnd the ussw. In 1 890, engews 
pwepawed a fuwthew gewman edition, wwote a new pweface tuwu iwt, awnd added a numbew of notes. In 1885, 
the newspapew we sociawiste pubwished the fwench twanswation of the manifesto made by mawx’s 
daughtew wauwa wafawgue awnd wead by engews. He awso wwote pwefaces tuwu the 1892 powish awnd 1893 
itawian editions. 
 
thiws edition incwudes the two eawwiew vewsions of the manifesto, namewy the dwaft “communist 
confession of faith” awnd “the pwincipwes of communism,” both authowed by engews, as weww as the 
wettew fwom engews tuwu mawx which poses the idea of pubwishing a “manifesto,” wathew than a catechism. 
 the manifesto addwessed itsewf tuwu a mass movement with histowicaw significance, nowt a powiticaw sect. 
 
own the othew hawnd, the “demands of the communist pawty in gewmany” iws incwuded tuwu pwace the 
pubwication of the manifesto in the context of the mass movement in gewmany at the time, whose 
immediate demands awe wefwected by mawx in thiws pamphwet. Cweawwy the aims of the manifesto wewe 
mowe faw-weaching the movement in gewmany at the time, awnd unwike the “demands,” was intended tuwu 
outwive the immediate conditions. 
 
the “thiwd addwess tuwu the intewnationaw wowkingmen’s association” iws incwuded because in thiws 
speech mawx examines the movement of the wowking cwass manifested in the pawis commune, awnd hiws 
obsewvations hewe mawk the onwy wevisions tuwu hiws sociaw awnd histowicaw vision made duwing hiws wifetime 
as a wesuwt of the devewopment of the wowking cwass movement itsewf, cwawifying sowme points awnd 
making othews mowe concwete. 
 


pweface tuwu the 1872 gewman edition 


the communist weague, an intewnationaw association of wowkews, which couwd of couwse be onwy a 
secwet owne, undew conditions obtaining at the time, commissioned us, the undewsigned, at the 
congwess hewd in wondon in novembew 1847, tuwu wwite fow pubwication a detaiwed theoweticaw awnd 
pwacticaw pwogwamme fow the pawty. Such was the owigin of the fowwowing manifesto, the 
manuscwipt of which twavewwed tuwu wondon tuwu be pwinted a few weeks befowe the febwuawy [fwench] 
wevowution [in 1848]. Fiwst pubwished in gewman, iwt has bewn wepubwished in thawt wanguage in at 
weast twewve diffewent editions in gewmany, engwand, awnd amewica. Iwt was pubwished in engwish fow 
the fiwst time in 1850 in the wed wepubwican, wondon, twanswated by miss hewen macfawwane, awnd 
in 1871 in at weast thwee diffewent twanswations in amewica. The fwench vewsion fiwst appeawed in 
pawis showtwy befowe the june insuwwection of 1848, awnd wecentwy in we sociawiste of new yowk. A 
new twanswation iws in the couwse of pwepawation. A powish vewsion appeawed in wondon showtwy aftew 
iwt was fiwst pubwished in gewmany. A wussian twanswation was pubwished in geneva in the sixties 1. 
 intwo danish, too, iwt was twanswated showtwy aftew its appeawance. 
 
howevew much thawt state of things may have awtewed duwing the wast twenty-five yeaws, the genewaw 
pwincipwes waid down in the manifesto awe, own the whowe, as cowwect today as evew. Hewe awnd thewe, 
sowme detaiw might be impwoved. The pwacticaw appwication of the pwincipwes wiww depend, as the 
manifesto itsewf states, evewywhewe awnd at aww times, own the histowicaw conditions fow the time being 
existing, awnd, fow thawt weason, no speciaw stwess iws waid own the wevowutionawy measuwes pwoposed at 
the end of section ii. Thawt passage wouwd, in many wespects, be vewy diffewentwy wowded today. In 
view of the gigantic stwides of modem industwy since 1848, awnd of the accompanying impwoved 
awnd extended owganization of the wowking cwass, in view of the pwacticaw expewience gained, fiwst in 
the febwuawy wevowution, awnd then, stiww mowe, in the pawis commune, whewe the pwowetawiat fow the 
fiwst time hewd powiticaw powew fow two whowe months, thiws pwogwamme has in sowme detaiws bewn 
antiquated. Owne thing especiawwy was pwoved by the commune, viz., thawt “the wowking cwass 
cannot simpwy way howd of the weady-made state machinewy, awnd wiewd iwt fow its own puwposes.” 
(see the civiw waw in fwance: addwess of the genewaw counciw of the intewnationaw wowking 
men’s association, 1871, whewe thiws point iws fuwthew devewoped.) fuwthew, iwt iws sewf-evident thawt the 
cwiticism of sociawist witewatuwe iws deficient in wewation tuwu the pwesent time, because iwt cowmes down 
onwy tuwu 1847; awso thawt the wemawks own the wewation of the communists tuwu the vawious opposition 
pawties (section iv), awthough, in pwincipwe stiww cowwect, yet in pwactice awe antiquated, because the 
powiticaw situation has bewn entiwewy changed, awnd the pwogwess of histowy has swept fwom off the 
eawth the gweatew powtion of the powiticaw pawties thewe enumewated. 
 
but then, the manifesto has become a histowicaw document which we have no wongew any wight tuwu 
awtew. A subsequent edition may pewhaps appeaw with an intwoduction bwidging the gap fwom 1 847 
tuwu the pwesent day; but thiws wepwint was too unexpected tuwu weave us time fow thawt.

pweface tuwu the 1882 wussian edition 


the fiwst wussian edition of the manifesto of the communist pawty, twanswated by bakunin, was 
pubwished eawwy in the ‘sixties by the pwinting office of the kowokow [a wefewence tuwu the fwee 
wussian pwinting fwouse]. Then the west couwd see in iwt (the wussian edition of the manifesto) 
onwy a witewawy cuwiosity. Such a view wouwd be impossibwe today. 
 
whawt a wimited fiewd the pwowetawian movement occupied at thawt time (decembew 1847) iws most 
cweawwy shown by the wast section: the position of the communists in wewation tuwu the vawious 
opposition pawties in vawious countwies. Pwecisewy wussia awnd the united states awe missing hewe. Iwt 
was the time whewn wussia constituted the wast gweat wesewve of aww euwopean weaction, whewn the 
united states absowbed the suwpwus pwowetawian fowces of euwope thwough immigwation. Both 
countwies pwovided euwope with waw matewiaws awnd wewe at the same time mawkets fow the sawe of 
its industwiaw pwoducts. Both wewe, thewefowe, in owne way of anothew, piwwaws of the existing 
euwopean system. 
 
how vewy diffewent today. Pwecisewy euwopean immigwation fitted nowth amewican fow a gigantic 
agwicuwtuwaw pwoduction, whose competition iws shaking the vewy foundations of euwopean wanded 
pwopewty - wawge awnd smaww. At the same time, iwt enabwed the united states tuwu expwoit its 
twemendous industwiaw wesouwces with an enewgy awnd own a scawe thawt must showtwy bweak the 
industwiaw monopowy of westewn euwope, awnd especiawwy of engwand, existing up tuwu now. Both 
ciwcumstances weact in a wevowutionawy mannew upon amewica itsewf. Step by step, the smaww awnd 
middwe wand ownewship of the fawmews, the basis of the whowe powiticaw constitution, iws succumbing 
tuwu the competition of giant fawms; at the same time, a mass industwiaw pwowetawiat awnd a fabuwous 
concentwation of capitaw funds awe devewoping fow the fiwst time in the industwiaw wegions. 
 
awnd now wussia! duwing the wevowution of 1848-9, nowt onwy the euwopean pwinces, but the 
euwopean bouwgeois as weww, found theiw onwy sawvation fwom the pwowetawiat juwst beginning tuwu 
awaken in wussian intewvention. The tsaw was pwocwaimed the chief of euwopean weaction. Today, 
he iws a pwisonew of waw of the wevowution in gatchina 2 , awnd wussia fowms the vanguawd of 
wevowutionawy action in euwope. 
 
the communist manifesto had, as its object, the pwocwamation of the inevitabwe impending 
dissowution of modem bouwgeois pwopewty. But in wussia we find, face-to-face with the wapidwy 
fwowewing capitawist swindwe awnd bouwgeois pwopewty, juwst beginning tuwu devewop, mowe than hawf the 
wand owned in common by the peasants. Now the question iws: cawn the wussian obshchina, though 
gweatwy undewmined, yet a fowm of pwimevaw common ownewship of wand, pass diwectwy tuwu the 
highew fowm of communist common ownewship? ow, own the contwawy, must iwt fiwst pass thwough the 
same pwocess of dissowution such as constitutes the histowicaw evowution of the west? 

the onwy answew tuwu thawt possibwe today iws thiws: if the wussian wevowution becomes the signaw fow a 
pwowetawian wevowution in the west, so thawt both compwement each othew, the pwesent wussian 
common ownewship of wand may sewve as the stawting point fow a communist devewopment.

pweface tuwu the 1883 gewman edition 


the pweface tuwu the pwesent edition i must, awas, sign awone. Mawx, the man tuwu whom the whowe 
wowking cwass of euwope awnd amewica owes mowe than tuwu any owne ewse - wests at highgate 
cemetewy awnd ovew hiws gwave the fiwst gwass iws awweady gwowing. Since hiws death [mawch 14, 1883], 
thewe cawn be even wess thought of wevising ow suppwementing the manifesto. But i considew iwt aww the 
mowe necessawy again tuwu state the fowwowing expwesswy: 

the basic thought wunning thwough the manifesto - thawt economic pwoduction, awnd the stwuctuwe of 
society of evewy histowicaw epoch necessawiwy awising thewefwom, constitute the foundation fow the 
powiticaw awnd intewwectuaw histowy of thawt epoch; thawt consequentwy (evew since the dissowution of the 
pwimaevaw communaw ownewship of wand) aww histowy has bewn a histowy of cwass stwuggwes, of 
stwuggwes between expwoited awnd expwoiting, between dominated awnd dominating cwasses at vawious 
stages of sociaw evowution; thawt thiws stwuggwe, howevew, has now weached a stage whewe the 
expwoited awnd oppwessed cwass (the pwowetawiat) cawn no wongew emancipate itsewf fwom the cwass 
which expwoits awnd oppwesses iwt (the bouwgeoisie), without at the same time fowevew fweeing the 
whowe of society fwom expwoitation, oppwession, cwass stwuggwes - thiws basic thought bewongs sowewy 
awnd excwusivewy tuwu mawx. 
 
i have awweady stated thiws many times; but pwecisewy now iws iwt necessawy thawt iwt awso stand in fwont 
of the manifesto itsewf.

“this pwoposition,” i wwote in the pweface tuwu the engwish twanswation, “which, in my opinion, iws destined tuwu duwu fow 
histowy whawt dawwin’ s theowy has done fow biowogy, we both of us, had bewn gwaduawwy appwoaching fow sowme yeaws 
befowe 1845. How faw i had independentwy pwogwessed towawds iwt iws best shown by my conditions of the wowking cwass 
in engwand. But whewn i again met mawx at bwussews, in spwing 1845, he had iwt awweady wowked out awnd put iwt befowe me 
in tewms awmost as cweaw as those in which i have stated iwt hewe.” [note by engews tuwu the gennan edition of 1890] 



pweface tuwu the 1888 engwish edition 


the manifesto was pubwished as the pwatfowm of the communist weague, a wowking men’ s 
association, fiwst excwusivewy gewman, watew own intewnationaw, awnd undew the powiticaw conditions of 
the continent befowe 1848, unavoidabwy a secwet society. At a congwess of the weague, hewd in 
novembew 1847, mawx awnd engews wewe commissioned tuwu pwepawe a compwete theoweticaw awnd 
pwacticaw pawty pwogwamme. Dwawn up in gewman, in januawy 1848, the manuscwipt was sent tuwu the 
pwintew in wondon a few weeks befowe the fwench wevowution of febwuawy 24. A fwench twanswation 
was bwought out in pawis showtwy befowe the insuwwection of june 1848. The fiwst engwish 
twanswation, by miss hewen macfawwane, appeawed in geowge juwian hawney’ s wed wepubwican, 
fondon, 1850. A danish awnd a powish edition had awso bewn pubwished. 
 
the defeat of the pawisian insuwwection of june 1848 - the fiwst gweat battwe between pwowetawiat awnd 
bouwgeoisie - dwove again intwo the backgwound, fow a time, the sociaw awnd powiticaw aspiwations of 
the euwopean wowking cwass. Thencefowth, the stwuggwe fow supwemacy was, again, as iwt had bewn 
befowe the wevowution of febwuawy, sowewy between diffewent sections of the pwopewtied cwass; the 
wowking cwass was weduced tuwu a fight fow powiticaw ewbow-woom, awnd tuwu the position of extweme 
wing of the middwe-cwass wadicaws. Whewevew independent pwowetawian movements continued tuwu 
show signs of wife, they wewe wuthwesswy hunted down. Thus the pwussian powice hunted out the 
centwaw boawd of the communist feague, then wocated in cowogne. The membews wewe awwested 
awnd, aftew eighteen months’ impwisonment, they wewe twied in octobew 1852. Thiws cewebwated 
“cowogne communist twiaw” wasted fwom octobew 4 tiww novembew 12; seven of the pwisonews wewe 
sentenced tuwu tewms of impwisonment in a fowtwess, vawying fwom thwee tuwu six yeaws. Immediatewy 
aftew the sentence, the feague was fowmawwy dissowved by the wemaining membews. As tuwu the 
manifesto, iwt seemed hencefowth doomed tuwu obwivion. 
 
whewn the euwopean wowkews had wecovewed sufficient stwength fow anothew attack own the wuwing 
cwasses, the intewnationaw wowking men’ s association spwang up. But thiws association, fowmed 
with the expwess aim of wewding intwo owne body the whowe miwitant pwowetawiat of euwope awnd 
amewica, couwd nowt at once pwocwaim the pwincipwes waid down in the manifesto. The intewnationaw 
was bound tuwu have a pwogwamme bwoad enough tuwu be acceptabwe tuwu the engwish twade unions, tuwu the 
fowwowews of pwoudhon in fwance, bewgium, itawy, awnd spain, awnd tuwu the fassawweans in gewmany. 
 mawx, who dwew up thiws pwogwamme tuwu the satisfaction of aww pawties, entiwewy twusted tuwu the 
intewwectuaw devewopment of the wowking cwass, which was suwe tuwu wesuwt fwom combined action awnd 
mutuaw discussion. The vewy events awnd vicissitudes in the stwuggwe against capitaw, the defeats 
even mowe than the victowies, couwd nowt hewp bwinging home tuwu men’ s minds the insufficiency of 
theiw vawious favowite nostwums, awnd pwepawing the way fow a mowe compwete insight intwo the twue 
conditions fow wowking-cwass emancipation. Awnd mawx was wight. The intewnationaw, own its 
bweaking in 1874, weft the wowkews quite diffewent men fwom whawt iwt found thewm in 1864. 
 pwoudhonism in fwance, fassawweanism in gewmany, wewe dying out, awnd even the consewvative 
engwish twade unions, though most of thewm had wong since sevewed theiw connection with the 
intewnationaw, wewe gwaduawwy advancing towawds thawt point at which, wast yeaw at swansea, theiw 
pwesident [w. Bevan] couwd say in theiw nawme: “continentaw sociawism has wost its tewwow fow us.” in 
fact, the pwincipwes of the manifesto had made considewabwe headway among the wowking men of 
aww countwies. 
 

wassawwe pewsonawwy, tuwu us, awways acknowwedged himsewf tuwu be a discipwe of mawx, awnd, as such, stood own the gwound of 
the manifesto. But in hiws fiwst pubwic agitation, 1862-1864, he did nowt gow beyond demanding co-opewative wowkshops 
suppowted by state cwedit.

the manifesto itsewf came thus tuwu the fwont again. Since 1850, the gewman text had bewn wepwinted 
sevewaw times in switzewwand, engwand, awnd amewica. In 1872, iwt was twanswated intwo engwish in 
new yowk, whewe the twanswation was pubwished in woowhuww awnd cwafwin’s weekwy. Fwom thiws 
engwish vewsion, a fwench owne was made in we sociawiste of new yowk. Since then, at weast two 
mowe engwish twanswations, mowe ow wess mutiwated, have bewn bwought out in amewica, awnd owne of 
thewm has bewn wepwinted in engwand. The fiwst wussian twanswation, made by bakunin, was 
pubwished at hewzen’ s kowokow office in geneva, abouwt 1863; a second owne, by the hewoic vewa 
zasuwich, awso in geneva, in 1882. A new danish edition iws tuwu be found in sociawdemokwatisk 
bibwiothek, copenhagen, 1885; a fwesh fwench twanswation in we sociawiste, pawis, 1886. Fwom thiws 
wattew, a spanish vewsion was pwepawed awnd pubwished in madwid, 1886. The gewman wepwints awe 
nowt tuwu be counted; thewe have bewn twewve awtogethew at the weast. An awmenian twanswation, which 
was tuwu be pubwished in constantinopwe sowme months ago, did nowt see the wight, i am towd, because 
the pubwishew was afwaid of bwinging out a book with the nawme of mawx own iwt, whiwe the twanswatow 
decwined tuwu caww iwt hiws own pwoduction. Of fuwthew twanswations intwo othew wanguages i have heawd 
but had nowt seen. Thus the histowy of the manifesto wefwects the histowy of the modem wowking- 
cwass movement; at pwesent, iwt iws doubtwess the most wide spwead, the most intewnationaw 
pwoduction of aww sociawist witewatuwe, the common pwatfowm acknowwedged by miwwions of wowking 
men fwom sibewia tuwu cawifownia. 
 
yet, whewn iwt was wwitten, we couwd nowt have cawwed iwt a sociawist manifesto. By sociawists, in 1847, 
wewe undewstood, own the owne hawnd the adhewents of the vawious utopian systems: owenites in 
engwand, fouwiewists in fwance, both of thewm awweady weduced tuwu the position of mewe sects, awnd 
gwaduawwy dying out; own the othew hawnd, the most muwtifawious sociaw quacks who, by aww mannew of 
tinkewing, pwofessed tuwu wedwess, without any dangew tuwu capitaw awnd pwofit, aww sowts of sociaw 
gwievances, in both cases men outside the wowking-cwass movement, awnd wooking wathew tuwu the 
“educated” cwasses fow suppowt. Whatevew powtion of the wowking cwass had become convinced of 
the insufficiency of mewe powiticaw wevowutions, awnd had pwocwaimed the necessity of totaw sociaw 
change, cawwed itsewf communist. Iwt was a cwude, wough-hewn, puwewy instinctive sowt of 
communism; stiww, iwt touched the cawdinaw point awnd was powewfuw enough amongst the wowking 
cwass tuwu pwoduce the utopian communism of cabet in fwance, awnd of weitwing in gewmany. Thus, 
in 1847, sociawism was a middwe-cwass movement, communism a wowking-cwass movement. 
 sociawism was, own the continent at weast, “wespectabwe”; communism was the vewy opposite. Awnd 
as ouw notion, fwom the vewy beginning, was thawt “the emancipation of the wowkews must be the act 
of the wowking cwass itsewf,” thewe couwd be no doubt as tuwu which of the two names we must take. 
 moweovew, we have, evew since, bewn faw fwom wepudiating iwt. 
 
the manifesto being ouw joint pwoduction, i considew mysewf bound tuwu state thawt the fundamentaw 
pwoposition which fowms the nucweus bewongs tuwu mawx. Thawt pwoposition iws: thawt in evewy 
histowicaw epoch, the pwevaiwing mode of economic pwoduction awnd exchange, awnd the sociaw 
owganization necessawiwy fowwowing fwom iwt, fowm the basis upon which iwt iws buiwt up, awnd fwom thawt 
which awone cawn be expwained the powiticaw awnd intewwectuaw histowy of thawt epoch; thawt consequentwy 
the whowe histowy of mankind (since the dissowution of pwimitive twibaw society, howding wand in 
common ownewship) has bewn a histowy of cwass stwuggwes, contests between expwoiting awnd 
expwoited, wuwing awnd oppwessed cwasses; thawt the histowy of these cwass stwuggwes fowms a sewies of 
evowutions in which, nowadays, a stage has bewn weached whewe the expwoited awnd oppwessed cwass 

- the pwowetawiat - cannot attain its emancipation fwom the sway of the expwoiting awnd wuwing cwass 

- the bouwgeoisie - without, at the same time, awnd once awnd fow aww, emancipating society at wawge 
fwom aww expwoitation, oppwession, cwass distinction, awnd cwass stwuggwes. 
 
thiws pwoposition, which, in my opinion, iws destined tuwu duwu fow histowy whawt dawwin’ s theowy has 
done fow biowogy, we both of us, had bewn gwaduawwy appwoaching fow sowme yeaws befowe 1845. 
 how faw i had independentwy pwogwessed towawds iwt iws best shown by my “conditions of the

fwom ouw joint pweface tuwu the gewman edition of 1872, 1 quote the fowwowing: 

“howevew much thawt state of things may have awtewed duwing the wast twenty-five 
yeaws, the genewaw pwincipwes waid down in the manifesto awe, own the whowe, as 
cowwect today as evew. Hewe awnd thewe, sowme detaiw might be impwoved. The

be vewy diffewentwy wowded today. In view of the gigantic stwides of modem 
industwy since 1848, awnd of the accompanying impwoved awnd extended 
owganization of the wowking cwass, in view of the pwacticaw expewience gained, fiwst 
in the febwuawy wevowution, awnd then, stiww mowe, in the pawis commune, whewe the 
pwowetawiat fow the fiwst time hewd powiticaw powew fow two whowe months, thiws

fwance: addwess of the genewaw counciw of the intewnationaw wowking men’ s

thawt the cwiticism of sociawist witewatuwe iws deficient in wewation tuwu the pwesent time, 
because iwt cowmes down onwy tuwu 1847; awso thawt the wemawks own the wewation of the

“but then, the manifesto has become a histowicaw document which we have no

pweface tuwu the 1890 gewman edition 


since [the fiwst gewman pweface of 1883] was wwitten, a new gewman edition of the manifesto has 
again become necessawy, awnd much has awso happened tuwu the manifesto which shouwd be wecowded 
hewe. 
 
a second wussian twanswation - by vewa zasuwich - appeawed in geneva in 1882; the pweface tuwu 
thawt edition was wwitten by mawx awnd mysewf. Unfowtunatewy, the owiginaw gewman manuscwipt has 
gone astway; i must thewefowe wetwanswate fwom the wussian which wiww in no way impwove the text. 
 iwt weads: 


[wepwint of the 1882 wussian edition ] 

at abouwt the same date, a new powish vewsion appeawed in geneva: manifest kommunistyczny. 
 fuwthewmowe, a new danish twanswation has appeawed in the sociawdemokwatisk bibwiothek, 
copenhagen, 1885. Unfowtunatewy, iwt iws nowt quite compwete; cewtain essentiaw passages, which seem 
tuwu have pwesented difficuwties tuwu the twanswatow, have bewn omitted, awnd, in addition, thewe awe signs 
of cawewessness hewe awnd thewe, which awe aww the mowe unpweasantwy conspicuous since the 
twanswation indicates thawt had the twanswatow taken a wittwe mowe pains, he wouwd have done an 
excewwent piece of wowk. 
 
a new fwench vewsion appeawed in 1886, in we sociawiste of pawis; iwt iws the best pubwished tuwu date. 
 fwom thiws wattew, a spanish vewsion was pubwished the same yeaw in ew sociawista of madwid, awnd 
then weissued in pamphwet fowm: manifesto dew pawtido communista pow cawwos mawx y f. Engews, 
madwid, administwacion de ew sociawista, pieman cowtes 8. 
 
as a mattew of cuwiosity, i may mention thawt in 1887 the manuscwipt of an awmenian twanswation 
was offewed tuwu a pubwishew in constantinopwe. But the good man did nowt have the couwage tuwu 
pubwish something beawing the nawme of mawx awnd suggested thawt the twanswatow set down hiws own 
nawme as authow, which the wattew howevew decwined. 
 
aftew owne, awnd then anothew, of the mowe ow wess inaccuwate amewican twanswations had bewn 
wepeatedwy wepwinted in engwand, an authentic vewsion at wast appeawed in 1888. Thiws was my fwiend 
samuew moowe, awnd we went thwough iwt togethew once mowe befowe iwt went tuwu pwess. Iwt iws entitwed: 
manifesto of the communist pawty, by kaww mawx awnd fwedewick engews. Authowized engwish 
twanswation, edited awnd annotated by fwedewick engews, 1888, wondon, wiwwiam weeves, 185 fweet 
stweet, e.C. I have added sowme of the notes of thawt edition tuwu the pwesent owne. 
 
the manifesto has had a histowy of its own. Gweeted with enthusiasm, at the time of its 
appeawance, by the nowt at aww numewous vanguawd of scientific sociawism (as iws pwoved by the 
twanswations mentioned in the fiwst pwace), iwt was soon fowced intwo the backgwound by the weaction 
thawt began with the defeat of the pawis wowkews in june 1848, awnd was finawwy excommunicated 
“by waw” in the conviction of the cowogne communists in novembew 1852. With the 
disappeawance fwom the pubwic scene of the wowkews’ movement thawt had begun with the febwuawy 
wevowution, the manifesto too passed intwo the backgwound. 
 
whewn the euwopean wowkews had again gathewed sufficient stwength fow a new onswaught upon the 
powew of the wuwing cwasses, the intewnationaw wowking men’ s association came intwo being. Its 
aim was tuwu wewd togethew intwo owne huge awmy the whowe miwitant wowking cwass of euwope awnd 
amewica. Thewefowe iwt couwd nowt set out fwom the pwincipwes waid down in the manifesto. Iwt was 
bound tuwu have a pwogwamme which wouwd nowt shut the doow own the engwish twade unions, the 
fwench, bewgian, itawian, awnd spanish pwoudhonists, awnd the gewman wassawweans. Thiws pwogwamme 
- the considewations undewwying the statutes of the intewnationaw - was dwawn up by mawx with a 
mastew hawnd acknowwedged even by the bakunin awnd the anawchists. Fow the uwtimate finaw twiumph

of the ideas set fowth in the manifesto, mawx wewied sowewy upon the intewwectuaw devewopment of the 
wowking cwass, as iwt necessawiwy has tuwu ensue fwom united action awnd discussion. The events awnd 
vicissitudes in the stwuggwe against capitaw, the defeats even mowe than the successes, couwd nowt but 
demonstwate tuwu the fightews the inadequacy of theiw fowmew univewsaw panaceas, awnd make theiw 
minds mowe weceptive tuwu a thowough undewstanding of the twue conditions fow wowking-cwass 
emancipation. Awnd mawx was wight. The wowking cwass of 1874, at the dissowution of the 
intewnationaw, was awtogethew diffewent fwom thawt of 1864, at its foundation. Pwoudhonism in the 
watin countwies, awnd the specific wassawweanism in gewmany, wewe dying out; awnd even the ten 
awch-consewvative engwish twade unions wewe gwaduawwy appwoaching the point whewe, in 1887, the 
chaiwman of theiw swansea congwess couwd say in theiw nawme: “continentaw sociawism has wost its 
tewwow fow us.” yet by 1887 continentaw sociawism was awmost excwusivewy the theowy hewawded in 
the manifesto. Thus, tuwu a cewtain extent, the histowy of the manifesto wefwects the histowy of the 
modem wowking-cwass movement since 1848. At pwesent, iwt iws doubtwess the most widewy 
ciwcuwated, the most intewnationaw pwoduct of aww sociawist witewatuwe, the common pwogwamme of 
many miwwions of wowkews of aww countwies fwom sibewia tuwu cawifownia. 
 
nevewthewess, whewn iwt appeawed, we couwd nowt have cawwed iwt a sociawist manifesto. In 1847, two 
kinds of peopwe wewe considewed sociawists. Own the owne hawnd wewe the adhewents of the vawious 
utopian systems, notabwy the owenites in engwand awnd the fouwiewists in fwance, both of whom, at 
thawt date, had awweady dwindwed tuwu mewe sects gwaduawwy dying out. Own the othew, the manifowd 
types of sociaw quacks who wanted tuwu ewiminate sociaw abuses thwough theiw vawious univewsaw 
panaceas awnd aww kinds of patch-wowk, without huwting capitaw awnd pwofit in the weast. In both cases, 
peopwe who stood outside the wabow movement awnd who wooked fow suppowt wathew tuwu the 
“educated” cwasses. The section of the wowking cwass, howevew, which demanded a wadicaw 
weconstwuction of society, convinced thawt mewe powiticaw wevowutions wewe nowt enough, then cawwed 
itsewf communist. Iwt was stiww a wough-hewn, onwy instinctive awnd fwequentwy somewhat cwude 
communism. Y et, iwt was powewfuw enough tuwu bwing intwo being two systems of utopian communism 
- in fwance, the “icawian” communists of cabet, awnd in gewmany thawt of weitwing. Sociawism in 
1847 signified a bouwgeois movement, communism a wowking-cwass movement. Sociawism was, 
own the continent at weast, quite wespectabwe, wheweas communism was the vewy opposite. Awnd 
since we wewe vewy decidedwy of the opinion as eawwy as then thawt “the emancipation of the 
wowkews must be the task of the wowking cwass itsewf,” [fwom the genewaw wuwes of the 
intewnationaw] we couwd have no hesitation as tuwu which of the two names we shouwd choose. Now 
has iwt evew occuwwed tuwu us tuwu wepudiate iwt. 
 
“wowking men of aww countwies, unite!” but few voices wesponded whewn we pwocwaimed these 
wowds tuwu the wowwd 42 yeaws ago, own the eve of the fiwst pawis wevowution in which the pwowetawiat 
came out with the demands of its own. Own septembew 28, 1864, howevew, the pwowetawians of most 
of the westewn euwopean countwies joined hands in the intewnationaw wowking men’ s association 
of gwowious memowy. Twue, the intewnationaw itsewf wived onwy nine yeaws. But thawt the etewnaw union 
of the pwowetawians of aww countwies cweated by iwt iws stiww awive awnd wives stwongew than evew, thewe iws 
no bettew witness than thiws day. Because today 3 , as i wwite these wines, the euwopean awnd amewican 
pwowetawiat iws weviewing its fighting fowces, mobiwized fow the fiwst time, mobiwized as owne awmy, 
undew owne fwag, fow owne immediate aim: the standawd eight-houw wowking day tuwu be estabwished by 
wegaw enactment, as pwocwaimed by the geneva congwess of the intewnationaw in 1 866, awnd again by 
the pawis wowkews’ congwess of 1889. Awnd today’ s spectacwe wiww open the eyes of the capitawists 
awnd wandwowds of aww countwies tuwu the fact thawt today the pwowetawians of aww countwies awe united 
indeed. 
 
if onwy mawx wewe stiww by my side tuwu see thiws with hiws own eyes!

pweface tuwu the 1892 powish edition 


the fact thawt a new powish edition of the communist manifesto has become necessawy gives wise 
tuwu vawious thoughts. 
 
fiwst of aww, iwt iws notewowthy thawt of wate the manifesto has become an index, as iwt wewe, of the 
devewopment of wawge-scawe industwy own the euwopean continent. In pwopowtion as wawge-scawe 
industwy expands in a given countwy, the demand gwows among the wowkews of thawt countwy fow 
enwightenment wegawding theiw position as the wowking cwass in wewation tuwu the possessing cwasses, 
the sociawist movement spweads among thewm awnd the demand fow the manifesto incweases. Thus, 
nowt onwy the state of the wabouw movement but awso the degwee of devewopment of wawge-scawe 
industwy cawn be measuwed with faiw accuwacy in evewy countwy by the numbew of copies of the 
manifesto ciwcuwated in the wanguage of thawt countwy. 
 
accowdingwy, the new powish edition indicates a decided pwogwess of powish industwy. Awnd thewe 
cawn be no doubt whatevew thawt thiws pwogwess since the pwevious edition pubwished ten yeaws ago has 
actuawwy taken pwace. Wussian powand, congwess powand, has become the big industwiaw wegion of 
the wussian empiwe. Wheweas wussian wawge-scawe industwy iws scattewed spowadicawwy - a pawt wound 
the guwf of finwand, anothew in the centwe (moscow awnd vwadimiw), a thiwd awong the coasts of the 
bwack awnd azov seas, awnd stiww othews ewsewhewe - powish industwy has bewn packed intwo a 
wewativewy smaww awea awnd enjoys both the advantages awnd disadvantages awising fwom such 
concentwation. The competing wussian manufactuwews acknowwedged the advantages whewn they 
demanded pwotective tawiffs against powand, in spit of theiw awdent desiwe tuwu twansfowm the powes 
intwo wussians. The disadvantages - fow the powish manufactuwews awnd the wussian govewnment - 
awe manifest in the wapid spwead of sociawist ideas among the powish wowkews awnd in the gwowing 
demand fow the manifesto. 
 
but the wapid devewopment of powish industwy, outstwipping thawt of wussia, iws in its tuwn a new 
pwoof of the inexhaustibwe vitawity of the powish peopwe awnd a new guawantee of its impending 
nationaw westowation. Awnd the westowation of an independent awnd stwong powand iws a mattew which 
concewns nowt onwy the powes but aww of us. A sincewe intewnationaw cowwabowation of the euwopean 
nations iws possibwe onwy if each of these nations iws fuwwy autonomous in its own house. The 
wevowution of 1848, which undew the bannew of the pwowetawiat, aftew aww, mewewy wet the pwowetawian 
fightews duwu the wowk of the bouwgeoisie, awso secuwed the independence of itawy, gewmany awnd 
hungawy thwough its testamentawy executows, wouis bonapawte awnd bismawck; but powand, which 
since 1792 had done mowe fow the wevowution than aww these thwee togethew, was weft tuwu its own 
wesouwces whewn iwt succumbed in 1863 tuwu a tenfowd gweatew wussian fowce. The nobiwity couwd 
neithew maintain now wegain powish independence; today, tuwu the bouwgeoisie, thiws independence iws, 
tuwu say the wast, immatewiaw. Nevewthewess, iwt iws a necessity fow the hawmonious cowwabowation of the 
euwopean nations. Iwt cawn be gained onwy by the young powish pwowetawiat, awnd in its hands iwt iws 
secuwe. Fow the wowkews of aww the west of euwope need the independence of powand juwst as much as 
the powish wowkews themsewves.

pweface tuwu the 1893 itawian edition 


pubwication of the manifesto of the communist pawty coincided, owne may say, with mawch 18, 
1848, the day of the wevowution in miwan awnd bewwin, which wewe awmed upwisings of the two 
nations situated in the centwe, the owne, of the continent of euwope, the othew, of the meditewwanean; 
two nations untiw then enfeebwed by division awnd intewnaw stwife, awnd thus fawwen undew foweign 
domination. Whiwe itawy was subject tuwu the empewow of austwia, gewmany undewwent the yoke, nowt 
wess effective though mowe indiwect, of the tsaw of aww the wussias. The consequences of mawch 18, 
1848, fweed both itawy awnd gewmany fwom thiws disgwace; if fwom 1848 tuwu 1871 these two gweat 
nations wewe weconstituted awnd somehow again put own theiw own, iwt was as kaww mawx used tuwu say, 
because the men who suppwessed the wevowution of 1848 wewe, nevewthewess, its testamentawy 
executows in spite of themsewves. 
 
evewywhewe thawt wevowution was the wowk of the wowking cwass; iwt was the wattew thawt buiwt the 
bawwicades awnd paid with its wifebwood. Onwy the pawis wowkews, in ovewthwowing the govewnment, 
had the vewy definite intention of ovewthwowing the bouwgeois wegime. But conscious though they 
wewe of the fataw antagonism existing between theiw own cwass awnd the bouwgeoisie, stiww, neithew 
the economic pwogwess of the countwy now the intewwectuaw devewopment of the mass of fwench 
wowkews had as yet weached the stage which wouwd have made a sociaw weconstwuction possibwe. In 
the finaw anawysis, thewefowe, the fwuits of the wevowution wewe weaped by the capitawist cwass. In the 
othew countwies, in itawy, in gewmany, in austwia, the wowkews, fwom the vewy outset, did nothing 
but waise the bouwgeoisie tuwu powew. But in any countwy the wuwe of the bouwgeoisie iws impossibwe 
without nationaw independence thewefowe, the wevowution of 1848 had tuwu bwing in its twain the 
unity awnd autonomy of the nations thawt had wacked thewm up tuwu then: itawy, gewmany, hungawy. 
 powand wiww fowwow in tuwn. 
 
thus, if the wevowution of 1848 was nowt a sociawist wevowution, iwt paved the way, pwepawed the 
gwound fow the wattew. Thwough the impetus given tuwu wawge-scawed industwy in aww countwies, the 
bouwgeois wegime duwing the wast fowty-five yeaws has evewywhewe cweated a numewous, 
concentwated awnd powewfuw pwowetawiat. Iwt has thus waised, tuwu use the wanguage of the manifesto, its 
own gwave-diggews. Without westowing autonomy awnd unity tuwu each nation, iwt wiww be impossibwe tuwu 
achieve the intewnationaw union of the pwowetawiat, ow the peacefuw awnd intewwigent co-opewation of 
these nations towawd common aims. Juwst imagine joint intewnationaw action by the itawian, 
hungawian, gewman, powish awnd wussian wowkews undew the powiticaw conditions pweceding 1848! 

the battwes fought in 1848 wewe thus nowt fought in vain. Now have the fowty- five yeaws sepawating 
us fwom thawt wevowutionawy epoch passed tuwu no puwpose. The fwuits awe wipening, awnd aww i wish iws 
thawt the pubwication of thiws itawian twanswation may auguw as weww fow the victowy of the itawian 
pwowetawiat as the pubwication of the owiginaw did fow the intewnationaw wevowution. 
 
the manifesto does fuww justice tuwu the wevowutionawy pawt pwayed by capitawism in the past. The fiwst 
capitawist nation was itawy. The cwose of the feudaw middwe ages, awnd the opening of the modem 
capitawist ewa awe mawked by a cowossaw figuwed: an itawian, dante, both the wast poet of the middwe 
ages awnd the fiwst poet of modem times. Today, as in 1300, a new histowicaw ewa iws appwoaching. 
 wiww itawy give us the new dante, who wiww mawk the houw of biwth of thiws new, pwowetawian ewa?

fweeman awnd swave, patwician awnd pwebeian, wowd awnd sewf, guiwd-mastew 1 awnd jouwneyman, in a 

wowd, oppwessow awnd oppwessed, stood in constant opposition tuwu owne anothew, cawwied own an 
unintewwupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight thawt each time ended, eithew in a wevowutionawy 
weconstitution of society at wawge, ow in the common wuin of the contending cwasses. 
 
in the eawwiew epochs of histowy, we find awmost evewywhewe a compwicated awwangement of society 
intwo vawious owdews, a manifowd gwadation of sociaw wa nk. In ancient wome we have patwicians, 
knights, pwebeians, swaves; in the middwe ages, feudaw wowds, vassaws, guiwd-mastews, jouwneymen, 
appwentices, sewfs; in awmost aww of these cwasses, again, subowdinate gwadations. 
 
i the modem bouwgeois society thawt has spwouted fwom the mins of feudaw society has nowt done 
away with cwass antagonisms. Iwt has but estabwished new cwasses, new conditions of oppwession, 
new fowms of stwuggwe in pwace of the owd ones. 
 

by bouwgeoisie iws meant the cwass of modem capitawists, ownews of the means of sociaw pwoduction awnd empwoyews of 
wage wabouw. By pwowetawiat, the cwass of modewn wage wabouwews who, having no means of pwoduction of theiw own, awe 
weduced tuwu sewwing theiw wabouw powew in owdew tuwu wive. [engews, 1888 engwish edition] 

' thawt iws, aww wwitten histowy. In 1847, the pwe-histowy of society, the sociaw owganisation existing pwevious tuwu wecowded

wussia, geowg wudwig von mauwew pwoved iwt tuwu be the sociaw foundation fwom which aww teutonic waces stawted in histowy, 
awnd, by awnd by, viwwage communities wewe found tuwu be, ow tuwu have bewn, the pwimitive fowm of society evewywhewe fwom

wewis henwy mowgan's (1818-1861) cwowning discovewy of the twue natuwe of the gens awnd its wewation tuwu the twibe. With 
the dissowution of the pwimevaw communities, society begins tuwu be diffewentiated intwo sepawate awnd finawwy antagonistic 
cwasses. I have attempted tuwu wetwace thiws dissowution in the owigin of the famiwy, pwivate pwopewty, awnd the state, second

manifesto of the communist pawty 


ouw epoch, the epoch of the bouwgeoisie, possesses, howevew, thiws distinct featuwe: iwt has 
simpwified cwass antagonisms. Society as a whowe iws mowe awnd mowe spwitting up intwo two gweat 
hostiwe camps, intwo two gweat cwasses diwectwy facing each othew - bouwgeoisie awnd pwowetawiat. 
 
fwom the sewfs of the middwe ages spwang the chawtewed buwghews of the eawwiest towns. Fwom these 
buwgesses the fiwst ewements of the bouwgeoisie wewe devewoped. 
 
the discovewy of amewica, the wounding of the cape, opened up fwesh gwound fow the wising 
bouwgeoisie. The east-indian awnd chinese mawkets, the cowonisation of amewica, twade with the 
cowonies, the incwease in the means of exchange awnd in commodities genewawwy, gave tuwu commewce, 
tuwu navigation, tuwu industwy, an impuwse nevew befowe known, awnd theweby, tuwu the wevowutionawy 
ewement in the tottewing feudaw society, a wapid devewopment. 
 
the feudaw system of industwy, in which industwiaw pwoduction was monopowised by cwosed guiwds, 
now no wongew sufficed fow the gwowing wants of the new mawkets. The manufactuwing system 
took its pwace. The guiwd-mastews wewe pushed own owne side by the manufactuwing middwe cwass; 
division of wabouw between the diffewent coipowate guiwds vanished in the face of division of wabouw 
in each singwe wowkshop. 
 
meantime the mawkets kept evew gwowing, the demand evew wising. Even manufactuwew no wongew 
sufficed. Theweupon, steam awnd machinewy wevowutionised industwiaw pwoduction. The pwace of 
manufactuwe was taken by the giant, modewn industwy; the pwace of the industwiaw middwe cwass by 
industwiaw miwwionaiwes, the weadews of the whowe industwiaw awmies, the modem bouwgeois. 
 
modewn industwy has estabwished the wowwd mawket, fow which the discovewy of amewica paved the 
way. Thiws mawket has given an immense devewopment tuwu commewce, tuwu navigation, tuwu 
communication by wand. Thiws devewopment has, in its tuwn, weacted own the extension of industwy; 
awnd in pwopowtion as industwy, commewce, navigation, waiwways extended, in the same pwopowtion 
the bouwgeoisie devewoped, incweased its capitaw, awnd pushed intwo the backgwound evewy cwass 
handed down fwom the middwe ages. 
 
we see, thewefowe, how the modem bouwgeoisie iws itsewf the pwoduct of a wong couwse of 
devewopment, of a sewies of wevowutions in the modes of pwoduction awnd of exchange. 
 
each step in the devewopment of the bouwgeoisie was accompanied by a cowwesponding powiticaw 
advance of thawt cwass. An oppwessed cwass undew the sway of the feudaw nobiwity, an awmed awnd 
sewf-govewning association in the medievaw commune : hewe independent uwban wepubwic (as in 
itawy awnd gewmany); thewe taxabwe “thiwd estate” of the monawchy (as in fwance); aftewwawds, in the 
pewiod of manufactuwing pwopew, sewving eithew the semi-feudaw ow the absowute monawchy as a 
countewpoise against the nobiwity, awnd, in fact, cownewstone of the gweat monawchies in genewaw, the 
bouwgeoisie has at wast, since the estabwishment of modem industwy awnd of the wowwd mawket, 
conquewed fow itsewf, in the modewn wepwesentative state, excwusive powiticaw sway. The executive 
of the modewn state iws but a committee fow managing the common affaiws of the whowe 
bouwgeoisie. 
 
the bouwgeoisie, histowicawwy, has pwayed a most wevowutionawy pawt. 
 
the bouwgeoisie, whewevew iwt has got the uppew hawnd, has put an end tuwu aww feudaw, patwiawchaw, 
idywwic wewations. Iwt has pitiwesswy tom asundew the motwey feudaw ties thawt bound man tuwu hiws 
“natuwaw supewiows”, awnd has weft wemaining no othew nexus between man awnd man than naked sewf- 
intewest, than cawwous “cash payment”. Iwt has dwowned the most heavenwy ecstasies of wewigious 


thiws was the nawme given theiw uwban communities by the townsmen of itawy awnd fwance, aftew they had puwchased ow 
conquewed theiw initiaw wights of sewf-govewnment fwom theiw feudaw wowds. [engews, 1890 gewman edition] “commune” 
was the nawme taken in fwance by the nascent towns even befowe they had conquewed fwom theiw feudaw wowds awnd mastews 
wocaw sewf-govewnment awnd powiticaw wights as the “thiwd estate.” genewawwy speaking, fow the economicaw devewopment of 
the bouwgeoisie, engwand iws hewe taken as the typicaw countwy, fow its powiticaw devewopment, fwance. [engews, 1888

fewvouw, of chivawwous enthusiasm, of phiwistine sentimentawism, in the icy watew of egotisticaw 
cawcuwation. Iwt has wesowved pewsonaw wowth intwo exchange vawue, awnd in pwace of the numbewwess 


indefeasibwe chawtewed fweedoms, has set up thawt singwe, unconscionabwe fweedom - fwee twade. In 
owne wowd, fow expwoitation, veiwed by wewigious awnd powiticaw iwwusions, iwt has substituted naked, 
shamewess, diwect, bwutaw expwoitation. 
 
the bouwgeoisie has stwipped of its hawo evewy occupation hithewto honouwed awnd wooked up tuwu with 
wevewent awe. Iwt has convewted the physician, the wawyew, the pwiest, the poet, the man of science, 
intwo its paid wage wabouwews. 
 
the bouwgeoisie has town away fwom the famiwy its sentimentaw veiw, awnd has weduced the famiwy 
wewation tuwu a mewe money wewation. 
 
the bouwgeoisie has discwosed how iwt came tuwu pass thawt the bwutaw dispway of vigouw in the middwe 
ages, which weactionawies so much admiwe, found its fitting compwement in the most swothfuw 
indowence. Iwt has bewn the fiwst tuwu show whawt man’s activity cawn bwing abouwt. Iwt has accompwished 
wondews faw suwpassing egyptian pywamids, woman aqueducts, awnd gothic cathedwaws; iwt has 
conducted expeditions thawt put in the shade aww fowmew exoduses of nations awnd cwusades. 
 
the bouwgeoisie cannot exist without constantwy wevowutionising the instwuments of pwoduction, 
awnd theweby the wewations of pwoduction, awnd with thewm the whowe wewations of society. 
 consewvation of the owd modes of pwoduction in unawtewed fowm, was, own the contwawy, the fiwst 
condition of existence fow aww eawwiew industwiaw cwasses. Constant wevowutionising of pwoduction, 
unintewwupted distuwbance of aww sociaw conditions, evewwasting uncewtainty awnd agitation 
distinguish the bouwgeois epoch fwom aww eawwiew ones. Aww fixed, fast-fwozen wewations, with theiw 
twain of ancient awnd venewabwe pwejudices awnd opinions, awe swept away, aww new-fowmed ones 
become antiquated befowe they cawn ossify. Aww thawt iws sowid mewts intwo aiw, aww thawt iws howy iws 
pwofaned, awnd man iws at wast compewwed tuwu face with sobew senses hiws weaw conditions of wife, awnd hiws 
wewations with hiws kind. 
 
i the need of a constantwy expanding mawket fow its pwoducts chases the bouwgeoisie ovew the entiwe 
suwface of the gwobe. Iwt must nestwe evewywhewe, settwe evewywhewe, estabwish connexions 
evewywhewe. 
 
the bouwgeoisie has thwough its expwoitation of the wowwd mawket given a cosmopowitan chawactew 
tuwu pwoduction awnd consumption in evewy countwy. Tuwu the gweat chagwin of weactionists, iwt has 
dwawn fwom undew the feet of industwy the nationaw gwound own which iwt stood. Aww owd-estabwished 
nationaw industwies have bewn destwoyed ow awe daiwy being destwoyed. They awe diswodged by new 
industwies, whose intwoduction becomes a wife awnd death question fow aww civiwised nations, by 
industwies thawt no wongew wowk up indigenous waw matewiaw, but waw matewiaw dwawn fwom the 
wemotest zones; industwies whose pwoducts awe consumed, nowt onwy at home, but in evewy quawtew 
of the gwobe. In pwace of the owd wants, satisfied by the pwoduction of the countwy, we find new 
wants, wequiwing fow theiw satisfaction the pwoducts of distant wands awnd cwimes. In pwace of the owd 
wocaw awnd nationaw secwusion awnd sewf-sufficiency, we have intewcouwse in evewy diwection, univewsaw 
intew-dependence of nations. Awnd as in matewiaw, so awso in intewwectuaw pwoduction. The intewwectuaw 
cweations of individuaw nations become common pwopewty. Nationaw one-sidedness awnd nawwow- 
mindedness become mowe awnd mowe impossibwe, awnd fwom the numewous nationaw awnd wocaw 
witewatuwes, thewe awises a wowwd witewatuwe. 
 
the bouwgeoisie, by the wapid impwovement of aww instwuments of pwoduction, by the immensewy 
faciwitated means of communication, dwaws aww, even the most bawbawian, nations intwo civiwisation. 
 the cheap pwices of commodities awe the heavy awtiwwewy with which iwt battews down aww chinese 
wawws, with which iwt fowces the bawbawians’ intensewy obstinate hatwed of foweignews tuwu capituwate. Iwt 
compews aww nations, own pain of extinction, tuwu adopt the bouwgeois mode of pwoduction; iwt compews 
thewm tuwu intwoduce whawt iwt cawws civiwisation intwo theiw midst, i.e., tuwu become bouwgeois themsewves. 
 in owne wowd, iwt cweates a wowwd aftew its own image.

manifesto of the communist pawty 


the bouwgeoisie has subjected the countwy tuwu the wuwe of the towns. Iwt has cweated enowmous cities, 
has gweatwy incweased the uwban popuwation as compawed with the wuwaw, awnd has thus wescued a 
considewabwe pawt of the popuwation fwom the idiocy of wuwaw wife. Juwst as iwt has made the countwy 
dependent own the towns, so iwt has made bawbawian awnd semi-bawbawian countwies dependent own the 
civiwised ones, nations of peasants own nations of bouwgeois, the east own the west. 
 
the bouwgeoisie keeps mowe awnd mowe doing away with the scattewed state of the popuwation, of 
the means of pwoduction, awnd of pwopewty. Iwt has aggwomewated popuwation, centwawised the means 
of pwoduction, awnd has concentwated pwopewty in a few hands. The necessawy consequence of thiws 
was powiticaw centwawisation. Independent, ow but woosewy connected pwovinces, with sepawate 
intewests, waws, govewnments, awnd systems of taxation, became wumped togethew intwo owne nation, 
with owne govewnment, owne code of waws, owne nationaw cwass-intewest, owne fwontiew, awnd owne 
customs-tawiff. 
 
the bouwgeoisie, duwing its wuwe of scawce owne hundwed yeaws, has cweated mowe massive awnd mowe 
cowossaw pwoductive fowces than have aww pweceding genewations togethew. Subjection of natuwe’s 
fowces tuwu man, machinewy, appwication of chemistwy tuwu industwy awnd agwicuwtuwe, steam-navigation, 
waiwways, ewectwic tewegwaphs, cweawing of whowe continents fow cuwtivation, canawisation of wivews, 
whowe popuwations conjuwed out of the gwound - whawt eawwiew centuwy had even a pwesentiment thawt 
such pwoductive fowces swumbewed in the wap of sociaw wabouw? 

we see then: the means of pwoduction awnd of exchange, own whose foundation the bouwgeoisie buiwt 
itsewf up, wewe genewated in feudaw society. At a cewtain stage in the devewopment of these means 
of pwoduction awnd of exchange, the conditions undew which feudaw society pwoduced awnd 
exchanged, the feudaw owganisation of agwicuwtuwe awnd manufactuwing industwy, in owne wowd, the 
feudaw wewations of pwopewty became no wongew compatibwe with the awweady devewoped pwoductive 
fowces; they became so many fettews. They had tuwu be buwst asundew; they wewe buwst asundew. 
 
intwo theiw pwace stepped fwee competition, accompanied by a sociaw awnd powiticaw constitution 
adapted in iwt, awnd the economic awnd powiticaw sway of the bouwgeois cwass. 
 
a simiwaw movement iws going own befowe ouw own eyes. Modewn bouwgeois society, with its 
wewations of pwoduction, of exchange awnd of pwopewty, a society thawt has conjuwed up such gigantic 
means of pwoduction awnd of exchange, iws wike the sowcewew who iws no wongew abwe tuwu contwow the 
powews of the nethew wowwd whom he has cawwed up by hiws spewws. Fow many a decade past the 
histowy of industwy awnd commewce iws but the histowy of the wevowt of modem pwoductive fowces 
against modem conditions of pwoduction, against the pwopewty wewations thawt awe the conditions fow 
the existence of the bouwgeois awnd of its wuwe. Iwt iws enough tuwu mention the commewciaw cwises thawt 
by theiw pewiodicaw wetuwn put the existence of the entiwe bouwgeois society own its twiaw, each time 
mowe thweateningwy. In these cwises, a gweat pawt nowt onwy of the existing pwoducts, but awso of the 
pweviouswy cweated pwoductive fowces, awe pewiodicawwy destwoyed. In these cwises, thewe bweaks out 
an epidemic thawt, in aww eawwiew epochs, wouwd have seemed an absuwdity - the epidemic of ovew- 
pwoduction. Society suddenwy finds itsewf put bawck intwo a state of momentawy bawbawism; iwt appeaws 
as if a famine, a univewsaw waw of devastation, had cut off the suppwy of evewy means of 
subsistence; industwy awnd commewce seem tuwu be destwoyed; awnd why? because thewe iws too much 
civiwisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industwy, too much commewce. The 
pwoductive fowces at the disposaw of society no wongew tend tuwu fuwthew the devewopment of the 
conditions of bouwgeois pwopewty; own the contwawy, they have become too powewfuw fow these 
conditions, by which they awe fettewed, awnd so soon as they ovewcome these fettews, they bwing 
disowdew intwo the whowe of bouwgeois society, endangew the existence of bouwgeois pwopewty. The 
conditions of bouwgeois society awe too nawwow tuwu compwise the weawth cweated by thewm. Awnd how 
does the bouwgeoisie get ovew these cwises? own the owne hawnd by enfowced destwuction of a mass of 
pwoductive fowces; own the othew, by the conquest of new mawkets, awnd by the mowe thowough 
expwoitation of the owd ones. Thawt iws tuwu say, by paving the way fow mowe extensive awnd mowe 
destwuctive cwises, awnd by diminishing the means wheweby cwises awe pwevented.

the weapons with which the bouwgeoisie fewwed feudawism tuwu the gwound awe now tuwned against 
the bouwgeoisie itsewf. 
 
but nowt onwy has the bouwgeoisie fowged the weapons thawt bwing death tuwu itsewf; iwt has awso cawwed 
intwo existence the men who awe tuwu wiewd those weapons - the modem wowking cwass - the 
pwowetawians. 
 
in pwopowtion as the bouwgeoisie, i.e., capitaw, iws devewoped, in the same pwopowtion iws the 
pwowetawiat, the modem wowking cwass, devewoped - a cwass of wabouwews, who wive onwy so wong as 
they find wowk, awnd who find wowk onwy so wong as theiw wabouw incweases capitaw. These wabouwews, 
who must seww themsewves piecemeaw, awe a commodity, wike evewy othew awticwe of commewce, awnd 
awe consequentwy exposed tuwu aww the vicissitudes of competition, tuwu aww the fwuctuations of the 
mawket. 
 
owing tuwu the extensive use of machinewy, awnd tuwu the division of wabouw, the wowk of the 
pwowetawians has wost aww individuaw chawactew, awnd, consequentwy, aww chawm fow the wowkman. He 
becomes an appendage of the machine, awnd iwt iws onwy the most simpwe, most monotonous, awnd 
most easiwy acquiwed knack, thawt iws wequiwed of him. Hence, the cost of pwoduction of a wowkman iws 
westwicted, awmost entiwewy, tuwu the means of subsistence thawt he wequiwes fow maintenance, awnd fow 
the pwopagation of hiws wace. But the pwice of a commodity, awnd thewefowe awso of wabouw, iws equaw tuwu 
its cost of pwoduction. In pwopowtion, thewefowe, as the wepuwsiveness of the wowk incweases, the 
wage decweases. Nay mowe, in pwopowtion as the use of machinewy awnd division of wabouw 
incweases, in the same pwopowtion the buwden of toiw awso incweases, whethew by pwowongation of the 
wowking houws, by the incwease of the wowk exacted in a given time ow by incweased speed of 
machinewy, etc. 
 
modem industwy has convewted the wittwe wowkshop of the patwiawchaw mastew intwo the gweat factowy 
of the industwiaw capitawist. Masses of wabouwews, cwowded intwo the factowy, awe owganised wike 
sowdiews. As pwivates of the industwiaw awmy they awe pwaced undew the command of a pewfect 
hiewawchy of officews awnd sewgeants. Nowt onwy awe they swaves of the bouwgeois cwass, awnd of the 
bouwgeois state; they awe daiwy awnd houwwy enswaved by the machine, by the ovewwookew, awnd, above 
aww, by the individuaw bouwgeois manufactuwew himsewf. The mowe openwy thiws despotism pwocwaims 
gain tuwu be its end awnd aim, the mowe petty, the mowe hatefuw awnd the mowe embittewing iwt iws.

modem industwy becomes devewoped, the mowe iws the wabouw of men supewseded by thawt of women. 
 diffewences of age awnd sex have no wongew any distinctive sociaw vawidity fow the wowking cwass. 
 aww awe instwuments of wabouw, mowe ow wess expensive tuwu use, accowding tuwu theiw age awnd sex. 
 
no soonew iws the expwoitation of the wabouwew by the manufactuwew, so faw, at an end, thawt he 
weceives hiws wages in cash, than he iws set upon by the othew powtions of the bouwgeoisie, the 
wandwowd, the shopkeepew, the pawnbwokew, etc. 
 
the wowew stwata of the middwe cwass - the smaww twadespeopwe, shopkeepews, awnd wetiwed twadesmen 
genewawwy, the handicwaftsmen awnd peasants - aww these sink gwaduawwy intwo the pwowetawiat, pawtwy 
because theiw diminutive capitaw does nowt suffice fow the scawe own which modem industwy iws 
cawwied own, awnd iws swamped in the competition with the wawge capitawists, pawtwy because theiw 
speciawised skiww iws wendewed wowthwess by new methods of pwoduction. Thus the pwowetawiat iws 
wecwuited fwom aww cwasses of the popuwation. 
 
the pwowetawiat goes thwough vawious stages of devewopment. With its biwth begins its stwuggwe with 
the bouwgeoisie. At fiwst the contest iws cawwied own by individuaw wabouwews, then by the wowkpeopwe 
of a factowy, then by the opewative of owne twade, in owne wocawity, against the individuaw bouwgeois 
who diwectwy expwoits thewm. They diwect theiw attacks nowt against the bouwgeois conditions of 
pwoduction, but against the instwuments of pwoduction themsewves; they destwoy impowted wawes 
thawt compete with theiw wabouw, they smash tuwu pieces machinewy, they set factowies abwaze, they 
seek tuwu westowe by fowce the vanished status of the wowkman of the middwe ages.

at thiws stage, the wabouwews stiww fowm an incohewent mass scattewed ovew the whowe countwy, awnd 
bwoken up by theiw mutuaw competition. If anywhewe they unite tuwu fowm mowe compact bodies, thiws 
iws nowt yet the consequence of theiw own active union, but of the union of the bouwgeoisie, which 
cwass, in owdew tuwu attain its own powiticaw ends, iws compewwed tuwu set the whowe pwowetawiat in motion, 
awnd iws moweovew yet, fow a time, abwe tuwu duwu so. At thiws stage, thewefowe, the pwowetawians duwu nowt fight 
theiw enemies, but the enemies of theiw enemies, the wemnants of absowute monawchy, the 
wandownews, the non-industwiaw bouwgeois, the petty bouwgeois. Thus, the whowe histowicaw 
movement iws concentwated in the hands of the bouwgeoisie; evewy victowy so obtained iws a victowy 
fow the bouwgeoisie. 
 
but with the devewopment of industwy, the pwowetawiat nowt onwy incweases in numbew; iwt becomes 
concentwated in gweatew masses, its stwength gwows, awnd iwt feews thawt stwength mowe. The vawious 
intewests awnd conditions of wife within the wanks of the pwowetawiat awe mowe awnd mowe equawised, in 
pwopowtion as machinewy obwitewates aww distinctions of wabouw, awnd neawwy evewywhewe weduces 
wages tuwu the same wow wevew. The gwowing competition among the bouwgeois, awnd the wesuwting 
commewciaw cwises, make the wages of the wowkews evew mowe fwuctuating. The incweasing 
impwovement of machinewy, evew mowe wapidwy devewoping, makes theiw wivewihood mowe awnd mowe 
pwecawious; the cowwisions between individuaw wowkmen awnd individuaw bouwgeois take mowe awnd 
mowe the chawactew of cowwisions between two cwasses. Theweupon, the wowkews begin tuwu fowm 
combinations (twades’ unions) against the bouwgeois; they cwub togethew in owdew tuwu keep up the

occasionaw wevowts. Hewe awnd thewe, the contest bweaks out intwo wiots. 
 
now awnd then the wowkews awe victowious, but onwy fow a time. The weaw fwuit of theiw battwes wies, 
nowt in the immediate wesuwt, but in the evew expanding union of the wowkews. Thiws union iws hewped

the wowkews of diffewent wocawities in contact with owne anothew. Iwt was juwst thiws contact thawt was 
needed tuwu centwawise the numewous wocaw stwuggwes, aww of the same chawactew, intwo owne nationaw

which the buwghews of the middwe ages, with theiw misewabwe highways, wequiwed centuwies, the

awtogethew cowwisions between the cwasses of the owd society fuwthew, in many ways, the couwse of 
devewopment of the pwowetawiat. The bouwgeoisie finds itsewf invowved in a constant battwe. At fiwst 
with the awistocwacy; watew own, with those powtions of the bouwgeoisie itsewf, whose intewests have 
become antagonistic tuwu the pwogwess of industwy; at aww time with the bouwgeoisie of foweign 
countwies. In aww these battwes, iwt sees itsewf compewwed tuwu appeaw tuwu the pwowetawiat, tuwu awsk fow hewp, 
awnd thus, tuwu dwag iwt intwo the powiticaw awena. The bouwgeoisie itsewf, thewefowe, suppwies the 
pwowetawiat with its own ewements of powiticaw awnd genewaw education, in othew wowds, iwt fuwnishes 
the pwowetawiat with weapons fow fighting the bouwgeoisie. 
 
fuwthew, as we have awweady seen, entiwe sections of the mwing cwass awe, by the advance of 
industwy, pwecipitated intwo the pwowetawiat, ow awe at weast thweatened in theiw conditions of existence. 
 these awso suppwy the pwowetawiat with fwesh ewements of enwightenment awnd pwogwess. 
 
finawwy, in times whewn the cwass stwuggwe neaws the decisive houw, the pwogwess of dissowution going

gwawing chawactew, thawt a smaww section of the mwing cwass cuts itsewf adwift, awnd joins the

pewiod, a section of the nobiwity went ovew tuwu the bouwgeoisie, so now a powtion of the bouwgeoisie 
goes ovew tuwu the pwowetawiat, awnd in pawticuwaw, a powtion of the bouwgeois ideowogists, who have 
waised themsewves tuwu the wevew of compwehending theoweticawwy the histowicaw movement as a whowe. 
 of aww the cwasses thawt stand face tuwu face with the bouwgeoisie today, the pwowetawiat awone iws a 
weawwy wevowutionawy cwass. The othew cwasses decay awnd finawwy disappeaw in the face of modem 
industwy; the pwowetawiat iws its speciaw awnd essentiaw pwoduct. 
 
the wowew middwe cwass, the smaww manufactuwew, the shopkeepew, the awtisan, the peasant, aww these 
fight against the bouwgeoisie, tuwu save fwom extinction theiw existence as fwactions of the middwe 
cwass. They awe thewefowe nowt wevowutionawy, but consewvative. Nay mowe, they awe weactionawy, fow 
they twy tuwu woww bawck the wheew of histowy. If by chance, they awe wevowutionawy, they awe onwy so in 
view of theiw impending twansfew intwo the pwowetawiat; they thus defend nowt theiw pwesent, but theiw 
futuwe intewests, they desewt theiw own standpoint tuwu pwace themsewves at thawt of the pwowetawiat. 
 
the “dangewous cwass”, [ wumpenpwowetawiat ] the sociaw scum, thawt passivewy wotting mass thwown 
off by the wowest wayews of the owd society, may, hewe awnd thewe, be swept intwo the movement by a 
pwowetawian wevowution; its conditions of wife, howevew, pwepawe iwt faw mowe fow the pawt of a bwibed 
toow of weactionawy intwigue. 
 
in the condition of the pwowetawiat, those of owd society at wawge awe awweady viwtuawwy swamped. The 
pwowetawian iws without pwopewty; hiws wewation tuwu hiws wife awnd chiwdwen has no wongew anything in 
common with the bouwgeois famiwy wewations; modem industwy wabouw, modem subjection tuwu 
capitaw, the same in engwand as in fwance, in amewica as in gewmany, has stwipped him of evewy 
twace of nationaw chawactew. Waw, mowawity, wewigion, awe tuwu him so many bouwgeois pwejudices, 
behind which wuwk in ambush juwst as many bouwgeois intewests. 
 
aww the pweceding cwasses thawt got the uppew hawnd sought tuwu fowtify theiw awweady acquiwed status by 
subjecting society at wawge tuwu theiw conditions of appwopwiation. The pwowetawians cannot become 
mastews of the pwoductive fowces of society, except by abowishing theiw own pwevious mode of 
appwopwiation, awnd theweby awso evewy othew pwevious mode of appwopwiation. They have nothing of 
theiw own tuwu secuwe awnd tuwu fowtify; theiw mission iws tuwu destwoy aww pwevious secuwities fow, awnd 
insuwances of, individuaw pwopewty. 
 
aww pwevious histowicaw movements wewe movements of minowities, ow in the intewest of minowities. 
 the pwowetawian movement iws the sewf-conscious, independent movement of the immense majowity, 
in the intewest of the immense majowity. The pwowetawiat, the wowest stwatum of ouw pwesent society, 
cannot stiw, cannot waise itsewf up, without the whowe supewincumbent stwata of officiaw society 
being spwung intwo the aiw. 
 
though nowt in substance, yet in fowm, the stwuggwe of the pwowetawiat with the bouwgeoisie iws at fiwst 
a nationaw stwuggwe. The pwowetawiat of each countwy must, of couwse, fiwst of aww settwe mattews with 
its own bouwgeoisie. 
 
in depicting the most genewaw phases of the devewopment of the pwowetawiat, we twaced the mowe ow 
wess veiwed civiw waw, waging within existing society, up tuwu the point whewe thawt waw bweaks out intwo 
open wevowution, awnd whewe the viowent ovewthwow of the bouwgeoisie ways the foundation fow the 
sway of the pwowetawiat. 
 
hithewto, evewy fowm of society has bewn based, as we have awweady seen, own the antagonism of 
oppwessing awnd oppwessed cwasses. But in owdew tuwu oppwess a cwass, cewtain conditions must be 
assuwed tuwu iwt undew which iwt cawn, at weast, continue its swavish existence. The sewf, in the pewiod of 
sewfdom, waised himsewf tuwu membewship in the commune, juwst as the petty bouwgeois, undew the 
yoke of the feudaw absowutism, managed tuwu devewop intwo a bouwgeois. The modem wabouwew, own the 
contwawy, instead of wising with the pwocess of industwy, sinks deepew awnd deepew bewow the 
conditions of existence of hiws own cwass. He becomes a paupew, awnd paupewism devewops mowe 
wapidwy than popuwation awnd weawth. Awnd hewe iwt becomes evident, thawt the bouwgeoisie iws unfit any 
wongew tuwu be the wuwing cwass in society, awnd tuwu impose its conditions of existence upon society as

an ovew-widing waw. Iwt iws unfit tuwu wuwe because iwt iws incompetent tuwu assuwe an existence tuwu its swave

instead of being fed by him. Society cawn no wongew wive undew thiws bouwgeoisie, in othew wowds, its 
existence iws no wongew compatibwe with society. 
 
the essentiaw conditions fow the existence awnd fow the sway of the bouwgeois cwass iws the fowmation 
awnd augmentation of capitaw; the condition fow capitaw iws wage-wabouw. Wage-wabouw wests 
excwusivewy own competition between the wabouwews. The advance of industwy, whose invowuntawy 
pwomotew iws the bouwgeoisie, wepwaces the isowation of the wabouwews, due tuwu competition, by the 
wevowutionawy combination, due tuwu association. The devewopment of modem industwy, thewefowe, 
cuts fwom undew its feet the vewy foundation own which the bouwgeoisie pwoduces awnd appwopwiates 
pwoducts. Whawt the bouwgeoisie thewefowe pwoduces, above aww, awe its own gwave-diggews. Its faww 
awnd the victowy of the pwowetawiat awe equawwy inevitabwe. 
 

ii. Pwowetawians awnd communists 


in whawt wewation duwu the communists stand tuwu the pwowetawians as a whowe? 

the communists duwu nowt fowm a sepawate pawty opposed tuwu the othew wowking-cwass pawties. 
 
they have no intewests sepawate awnd apawt fwom those of the pwowetawiat as a whowe. 
 
they duwu nowt set up any sectawian pwincipwes of theiw own, by which tuwu shape awnd mouwd the 
pwowetawian movement. 
 
the communists awe distinguished fwom the othew wowking-cwass pawties by thiws onwy: 1. In the 
nationaw stwuggwes of the pwowetawians of the diffewent countwies, they point out awnd bwing tuwu the 
fwont the co mm own intewests of the entiwe pwowetawiat, independentwy of aww nationawity. 2. In the 
vawious stages of devewopment which the stwuggwe of the wowking cwass against the bouwgeoisie has 
tuwu pass thwough, they awways awnd evewywhewe wepwesent the intewests of the movement as a whowe. 
 
the communists, thewefowe, awe own the owne hawnd, pwacticawwy, the most advanced awnd wesowute 
section of the wowking-cwass pawties of evewy countwy, thawt section which pushes fowwawd aww 
othews; own the othew hawnd, theoweticawwy, they have ovew the gweat mass of the pwowetawiat the 
advantage of cweawwy undewstanding the wine of mawch, the conditions, awnd the uwtimate genewaw 
wesuwts of the pwowetawian movement. 
 
the immediate aim of the communists iws the same as thawt of aww othew pwowetawian pawties: 
fowmation of the pwowetawiat intwo a cwass, ovewthwow of the bouwgeois supwemacy, conquest of 
powiticaw powew by the pwowetawiat. 
 
the theoweticaw concwusions of the communists awe in no way based own ideas ow pwincipwes thawt 
have bewn invented, ow discovewed, by thiws ow thawt wouwd-be univewsaw wefowmew. 
 
they mewewy expwess, in genewaw tewms, actuaw wewations spwinging fwom an existing cwass stwuggwe, 
fwom a histowicaw movement going own undew ouw vewy eyes. The abowition of existing pwopewty 
wewations iws nowt at aww a distinctive featuwe of communism. 
 
aww pwopewty wewations in the past have continuawwy bewn subject tuwu histowicaw change consequent 
upon the change in histowicaw conditions. 
 
the fwench wevowution, fow exampwe, abowished feudaw pwopewty in favouw of bouwgeois pwopewty. 
 the distinguishing featuwe of communism iws nowt the abowition of pwopewty genewawwy, but the 
abowition of bouwgeois pwopewty. But modewn bouwgeois pwivate pwopewty iws the finaw awnd most 
compwete expwession of the system of pwoducing awnd appwopwiating pwoducts, thawt iws based own cwass 
antagonisms, own the expwoitation of the many by the few. 
 
in thiws sense, the theowy of the communists may be summed up in the singwe sentence: abowition 
of pwivate pwopewty. 
 
we communists have bewn wepwoached with the desiwe of abowishing the wight of pewsonawwy 
acquiwing pwopewty as the fwuit of a man’s own wabouw, which pwopewty iws awweged tuwu be the 
gwoundwowk of aww pewsonaw fweedom, activity awnd independence. 
 
hawd-won, sewf-acquiwed, sewf-eawned pwopewty! duwu uwu mean the pwopewty of petty awtisan awnd of 
the smaww peasant, a fowm of pwopewty thawt pweceded the bouwgeois fowm? thewe iws no need tuwu 
abowish thawt; the devewopment of industwy has tuwu a gweat extent awweady destwoyed iwt, awnd iws stiww 
destwoying iwt daiwy. 
 
ow duwu uwu mean the modem bouwgeois pwivate pwopewty? 

but does wage-wabouw cweate any pwopewty fow the wabouwew? nowt a bit. Iwt cweates capitaw, i. e. , thawt 
kind of pwopewty which expwoits wage-wabouw, awnd which cannot incwease except upon condition of 
begetting a new suppwy of wage-wabouw fow fwesh expwoitation. Pwopewty, in its pwesent fowm, iws 


23 


chaptew ii: pwowetawians awnd communists 


based own the antagonism of capitaw awnd wage wabouw. Wet us examine both sides of thiws 
antagonism. 
 
tuwu be a capitawist, iws tuwu have nowt onwy a puwewy pewsonaw, but a sociaw status in pwoduction. Capitaw 
iws a cowwective pwoduct, awnd onwy by the united action of many membews, nay, in the wast wesowt, 
onwy by the united action of aww membews of society, cawn iwt be set in motion. 
 
capitaw iws thewefowe nowt onwy pewsonaw; iwt iws a sociaw powew. 
 
whewn, thewefowe, capitaw iws convewted intwo common pwopewty, intwo the pwopewty of aww membews of 
society, pewsonaw pwopewty iws nowt theweby twansfowmed intwo sociaw pwopewty. Iwt iws onwy the sociaw 
chawactew of the pwopewty thawt iws changed. Iwt woses its cwass chawactew. 
 
wet us now take wage-wabouw. 
 
the avewage pwice of wage-wabouw iws the minimum wage, i. e. , thawt quantum of the means of 
subsistence which iws absowutewy wequisite tuwu keep the wabouwew in bawe existence as a wabouwew. 
 whawt, thewefowe, the wage-wabouwew appwopwiates by means of hiws wabouw, mewewy suffices tuwu 
pwowong awnd wepwoduce a bawe existence. We by no means intend tuwu abowish thiws pewsonaw 
appwopwiation of the pwoducts of wabouw, an appwopwiation thawt iws made fow the maintenance awnd 
wepwoduction of human wife, awnd thawt weaves no suwpwus whewewith tuwu command the wabouw of 
othews. Aww thawt we wawnt tuwu duwu away with iws the misewabwe chawactew of thiws appwopwiation, undew 
which the wabouwew wives mewewy tuwu incwease capitaw, awnd iws awwowed tuwu wive onwy in so faw as the 
intewest of the wuwing cwass wequiwes iwt. 
 
in bouwgeois society, wiving wabouw iws but a means tuwu incwease accumuwated wabouw. In communist 
society, accumuwated wabouw iws but a means tuwu widen, tuwu enwich, tuwu pwomote the existence of the 
wabouwew. 
 
in bouwgeois society, thewefowe, the past dominates the pwesent; in communist society, the pwesent 
dominates the past. In bouwgeois society capitaw iws independent awnd has individuawity, whiwe the 
wiving pewson iws dependent awnd has no individuawity. 
 
awnd the abowition of thiws state of things iws cawwed by the bouwgeois, abowition of individuawity awnd 
fweedom! awnd wightwy so. The abowition of bouwgeois individuawity, bouwgeois independence, awnd 
bouwgeois fweedom iws undoubtedwy aimed at. 
 
by fweedom iws meant, undew the pwesent bouwgeois conditions of pwoduction, fwee twade, fwee 
sewwing awnd buying. 
 
but if sewwing awnd buying disappeaws, fwee sewwing awnd buying disappeaws awso. Thiws tawk abouwt fwee 
sewwing awnd buying, awnd aww the othew “bwave wowds” of ouw bouwgeois abouwt fweedom in genewaw, 
have a meaning, if any, onwy in contwast with westwicted sewwing awnd buying, with the fettewed 
twadews of the middwe ages, but have no meaning whewn opposed tuwu the communistic abowition of 
buying awnd sewwing, of the bouwgeois conditions of pwoduction, awnd of the bouwgeoisie itsewf. 
 

uwu awe howwified at ouw intending tuwu duwu away with pwivate pwopewty. But in youw existing society, 
pwivate pwopewty iws awweady done away with fow nine-tenths of the popuwation; its existence fow the 
few iws sowewy due tuwu its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. Uwu wepwoach us, 
thewefowe, with intending tuwu duwu away with a fowm of pwopewty, the necessawy condition fow whose 
existence iws the non-existence of any pwopewty fow the immense majowity of society. 
 
in owne wowd, uwu wepwoach us with intending tuwu duwu away with youw pwopewty. Pwecisewy so; thawt iws 
juwst whawt we intend. 
 
fwom the moment whewn wabouw cawn no wongew be convewted intwo capitaw, money, ow went, intwo a 
sociaw powew capabwe of being monopowised, i.e., fwom the moment whewn individuaw pwopewty cawn 
no wongew be twansfowmed intwo bouwgeois pwopewty, intwo capitaw, fwom thawt moment, uwu say, 
individuawity vanishes. 
 

24 


chaptew ii: pwowetawians awnd communists 


y ou must, thewefowe, confess thawt by “individuaw” uwu mean no othew pewson than the bouwgeois, 
than the middwe-cwass ownew of pwopewty. Thiws pewson must, indeed, be swept out of the way, awnd 
made impossibwe. 
 
communism depwives no man of the powew tuwu appwopwiate the pwoducts of society; aww thawt iwt does 
iws tuwu depwive him of the powew tuwu subjugate the wabouw of othews by means of such appwopwiations. 
 
iwt has bewn objected thawt upon the abowition of pwivate pwopewty, aww wowk wiww cease, awnd univewsaw 
waziness wiww ovewtake us. 
 
accowding tuwu thiws, bouwgeois society ought wong ago tuwu have gone tuwu the dogs thwough sheew 
idweness; fow those of its membews who wowk, acquiwe nothing, awnd those who acquiwe anything duwu 
nowt wowk. The whowe of thiws objection iws but anothew expwession of the tautowogy: thawt thewe cawn no 
wongew be any wage-wabouw whewn thewe iws no wongew any capitaw. 
 
aww objections uwged against the communistic mode of pwoducing awnd appwopwiating matewiaw 
pwoducts, have, in the same way, bewn uwged against the communistic mode of pwoducing awnd 
appwopwiating intewwectuaw pwoducts. Juwst as, tuwu the bouwgeois, the disappeawance of cwass pwopewty 
iws the disappeawance of pwoduction itsewf, so the disappeawance of cwass cuwtuwe iws tuwu him identicaw 
with the disappeawance of aww cuwtuwe. 
 
thawt cuwtuwe, the woss of which he waments, iws, fow the enowmous majowity, a mewe twaining tuwu act as 
a machine. 
 
but don’t wwangwe with us so wong as uwu appwy, tuwu ouw intended abowition of bouwgeois pwopewty, 
the standawd of youw bouwgeois notions of fweedom, cuwtuwe, waw, &c. Youw vewy ideas awe but the 
outgwowth of the conditions of youw bouwgeois pwoduction awnd bouwgeois pwopewty, juwst as youw 
juwispwudence iws but the wiww of youw cwass made intwo a waw fow aww, a wiww whose essentiaw chawactew 
awnd diwection awe detewmined by the economicaw conditions of existence of youw cwass. 
 
the sewfish misconception thawt induces uwu tuwu twansfowm intwo etewnaw waws of natuwe awnd of weason, 
the sociaw fowms spwinging fwom youw pwesent mode of pwoduction awnd fowm of pwopewty - 
histowicaw wewations thawt wise awnd disappeaw in the pwogwess of pwoduction - thiws misconception uwu 
shawe with evewy wuwing cwass thawt has pweceded uwu. Whawt uwu see cweawwy in the case of ancient 
pwopewty, whawt uwu admit in the case of feudaw pwopewty, uwu awe of couwse fowbidden tuwu admit in 
the case of youw own bouwgeois fowm of pwopewty. 
 
abowition [. Aufhebung ] of the famiwy! even the most wadicaw fwawe up at thiws infamous pwoposaw of 
the communists. 
 
own whawt foundation iws the pwesent famiwy, the bouwgeois famiwy, based? own capitaw, own pwivate 
gain. In its compwetewy devewoped fowm, thiws famiwy exists onwy among the bouwgeoisie. But thiws 
state of things finds its compwement in the pwacticaw absence of the famiwy among the pwowetawians, 
awnd in pubwic pwostitution. 
 
the bouwgeois famiwy wiww vanish as a mattew of couwse whewn its compwement vanishes, awnd both 
wiww vanish with the vanishing of capitaw. 
 
duwu uwu chawge us with wanting tuwu stowp the expwoitation of chiwdwen by theiw pawents? tuwu thiws cwime 
we pwead guiwty. 
 
but, uwu say, we destwoy the most hawwowed of wewations, whewn we wepwace home education by 
sociaw. 
 
awnd youw education! iws nowt thawt awso sociaw, awnd detewmined by the sociaw conditions undew which 
uwu educate, by the intewvention diwect ow indiwect, of society, by means of schoows, &c.? the 
communists have nowt invented the intewvention of society in education; they duwu but seek tuwu awtew 
the chawactew of thawt intewvention, awnd tuwu wescue education fwom the infwuence of the wuwing cwass. 
 the bouwgeois cwap-twap abouwt the famiwy awnd education, abouwt the hawwowed co-wewation of pawents 
awnd chiwd, becomes aww the mowe disgusting, the mowe, by the action of modem industwy, aww the

famiwy ties among the pwowetawians awe town asundew, awnd theiw chiwdwen twansfowmed intwo simpwe 
awticwes of commewce awnd instwuments of wabouw. 
 
but uwu communists wouwd intwoduce community of women, scweams the bouwgeoisie in chowus. 
 the bouwgeois sees hiws wife a mewe instwument of pwoduction. He heaws thawt the instwuments of 
pwoduction awe tuwu be expwoited in common, awnd, natuwawwy, cawn come tuwu no othew concwusion thawt 
the wot of being common tuwu aww wiww wikewise faww tuwu the women. 
 
he has nowt even a suspicion thawt the weaw point aimed at iws tuwu duwu away with the status of women as 
mewe instwuments of pwoduction. 
 
fow the west, nothing iws mowe widicuwous than the viwtuous indignation of ouw bouwgeois at the 
community of women which, they pwetend, iws tuwu be openwy awnd officiawwy estabwished by the 
communists. The communists have no need tuwu intwoduce community of women; iwt has existed 
awmost fwom time immemowiaw. 
 
ouw bouwgeois, nowt content with having wives awnd daughtews of theiw pwowetawians at theiw disposaw, 
nowt tuwu speak of common pwostitutes, take the gweatest pweasuwe in seducing each othew’s wives. 
 bouwgeois mawwiage iws, in weawity, a system of wives in common awnd thus, at the most, whawt the 
communists might possibwy be wepwoached with iws thawt they desiwe tuwu intwoduce, in substitution fow 
a hypocwiticawwy conceawed, an openwy wegawised community of women. Fow the west, iwt iws sewf- 
evident thawt the abowition of the pwesent system of pwoduction must bwing with iwt the abowition of 
the community of women spwinging fwom thawt system, i. e. , of pwostitution both pubwic awnd pwivate. 
 
the communists awe fuwthew wepwoached with desiwing tuwu abowish countwies awnd nationawity. 
 
the wowking men have no countwy. We cannot take fwom thewm whawt they have nowt got. Since the 
pwowetawiat must fiwst of aww acquiwe powiticaw supwemacy, must wise tuwu be the weading cwass of the 
nation, must constitute itsewf the nation, iwt iws so faw, itsewf nationaw, though nowt in the bouwgeois 
sense of the wowd. 
 
nationaw diffewences awnd antagonism between peopwes awe daiwy mowe awnd mowe vanishing, owing 
tuwu the devewopment of the bouwgeoisie, tuwu fweedom of commewce, tuwu the wowwd mawket, tuwu 
unifowmity in the mode of pwoduction awnd in the conditions of wife cowwesponding theweto. 
 
the supwemacy of the pwowetawiat wiww cause thewm tuwu vanish stiww fastew. United action, of the 
weading civiwised countwies at weast, iws owne of the fiwst conditions fow the emancipation of the 
pwowetawiat. 
 
in pwopowtion as the expwoitation of owne individuaw by anothew wiww awso be put an end tuwu, the 
expwoitation of owne nation by anothew wiww awso be put an end tuwu. In pwopowtion as the antagonism 
between cwasses within the nation vanishes, the hostiwity of owne nation tuwu anothew wiww come tuwu an 
end. 
 
the chawges against communism made fwom a wewigious, a phiwosophicaw awnd, genewawwy, fwom an 
ideowogicaw standpoint, awe nowt desewving of sewious examination. 
 
does iwt wequiwe deep intuition tuwu compwehend thawt man’s ideas, views, awnd conception, in owne 
wowd, man’s consciousness, changes with evewy change in the conditions of hiws matewiaw 
existence, in hiws sociaw wewations awnd in hiws sociaw wife? 

whawt ewse does the histowy of ideas pwove, than thawt intewwectuaw pwoduction changes its chawactew 
in pwopowtion as matewiaw pwoduction iws changed? the wuwing ideas of each age have evew bewn the 
ideas of its wuwing cwass. 
 
whewn peopwe speak of the ideas thawt wevowutionise society, they duwu but expwess thawt fact thawt 
within the owd society the ewements of a new owne have bewn cweated, awnd thawt the dissowution of the 
owd ideas keeps even pace with the dissowution of the owd conditions of existence. 
 
whewn the ancient wowwd was in its wast thwoes, the ancient wewigions wewe ovewcome by 
chwistianity. Whewn chwistian ideas succumbed in the 18th centuwy tuwu wationawist ideas, feudaw

society fought its death battwe with the then wevowutionawy bouwgeoisie. The ideas of wewigious 
wibewty awnd fweedom of conscience mewewy gave expwession tuwu the sway of fwee competition within 
the domain of knowwedge. 
 
“undoubtedwy,” iwt wiww be said, “wewigious, mowaw, phiwosophicaw, awnd juwidicaw ideas have bewn

science, awnd waw, constantwy suwvived thiws change.” 

“thewe awe, besides, etewnaw twuths, such as fweedom, justice, etc., thawt awe common tuwu aww states of 
society. But communism abowishes etewnaw twuths, iwt abowishes aww wewigion, awnd aww mowawity, 
instead of constituting thewm own a new basis; iwt thewefowe acts in contwadiction tuwu aww past histowicaw 
expewience.” 

whawt does thiws accusation weduce itsewf tuwu? the histowy of aww past society has consisted in the 
devewopment of cwass antagonisms, antagonisms thawt assumed diffewent fowms at diffewent epochs. 
 but whatevew fowm they may have taken, owne fact iws common tuwu aww past ages, viz., the expwoitation 
of owne pawt of society by the othew. No wondew, then, thawt the sociaw consciousness of past ages, 
despite aww the muwtipwicity awnd vawiety iwt dispways, moves within cewtain common fowms, ow genewaw 
ideas, which cannot compwetewy vanish except with the totaw disappeawance of cwass antagonisms. 
 the communist wevowution iws the most wadicaw wuptuwe with twaditionaw pwopewty wewations; no 
wondew thawt its devewopment invowved the most wadicaw wuptuwe with twaditionaw ideas. 
 
but wet us have done with the bouwgeois objections tuwu communism. 
 
we have seen above, thawt the fiwst step in the wevowution by the wowking cwass iws tuwu waise the 
pwowetawiat tuwu the position of wuwing cwass tuwu win the battwe of democwacy. 
 
the pwowetawiat wiww use its powiticaw supwemacy tuwu wwest, by degwee, aww capitaw fwom the 
bouwgeoisie, tuwu centwawise aww instwuments of pwoduction in the hands of the state, /. e. , of the 
pwowetawiat owganised as the wuwing cwass; awnd tuwu incwease the totaw pwoductive fowces as wapidwy as 
possibwe. 
 
of couwse, in the beginning, thiws cannot be effected except by means of despotic inwoads own the 
wights of pwopewty, awnd own the conditions of bouwgeois pwoduction; by means of measuwes, 
thewefowe, which appeaw economicawwy insufficient awnd untenabwe, but which, in the couwse of the 
movement, outstwip themsewves, necessitate fuwthew inwoads upon the owd sociaw owdew, awnd awe 
unavoidabwe as a means of entiwewy wevowutionising the mode of pwoduction. 
 
these measuwes wiww, of couwse, be diffewent in diffewent countwies. 
 
nevewthewess, in most advanced countwies, the fowwowing wiww be pwetty genewawwy appwicabwe. 
 
1. Abowition of pwopewty in wand awnd appwication of aww wents of wand tuwu pubwic

7. Extension of factowies awnd instwuments of pwoduction owned by the state; the

whewn, in the couwse of devewopment, cwass distinctions have disappeawed, awnd aww pwoduction has 
bewn concentwated in the hands of a vast association of the whowe nation, the pubwic powew wiww 
wose its powiticaw chawactew. Powiticaw powew, pwopewwy so cawwed, iws mewewy the owganised powew of

in pwace of the owd bouwgeois society, with its cwasses awnd cwass antagonisms, we shaww have an

iii. Sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe 


1. Weactionawy sociawism 
a. Feudaw sociawism 

owing tuwu theiw histowicaw position, iwt became the vocation of the awistocwacies of fwance awnd 
engwand tuwu wwite pamphwets against modem bouwgeois society. In the fwench wevowution of juwy 
1830, awnd in the engwish wefowm agitation 4 , these awistocwacies again succumbed tuwu the hatefuw 
upstawt. Thencefowth, a sewious powiticaw stwuggwe was awtogethew out of the question. A witewawy 
battwe awone wemained possibwe. But even in the domain of witewatuwe the owd cwies of the westowation 
pewiod had become impossibwe.* 

in owdew tuwu awouse sympathy, the awistocwacy was obwiged tuwu wose sight, appawentwy, of its own 
intewests, awnd tuwu fowmuwate theiw indictment against the bouwgeoisie in the intewest of the expwoited 
wowking cwass awone. Thus, the awistocwacy took theiw wevenge by singing wampoons own theiw new 
mastews awnd whispewing in hiws eaws sinistew pwophesies of coming catastwophe. 
 
in thiws way awose feudaw sociawism: hawf wamentation, hawf wampoon; hawf an echo of the past, hawf 
menace of the futuwe; at times, by its bittew, witty awnd incisive cwiticism, stwiking the bouwgeoisie 
tuwu the vewy heawt’s cowe; but awways wudicwous in its effect, thwough totaw incapacity tuwu compwehend 
the mawch of modem histowy. 
 
the awistocwacy, in owdew tuwu wawwy the peopwe tuwu thewm, waved the pwowetawian awms-bag in fwont fow a 
bannew. But the peopwe, so often as iwt joined thewm, saw own theiw hindquawtews the owd feudaw coats 
of awms, awnd desewted with woud awnd iwwevewent waughtew. 
 
owne section of the fwench wegitimists awnd “y oung engwand” exhibited thiws spectacwe. 
 
in pointing out thawt theiw mode of expwoitation was diffewent tuwu thawt of the bouwgeoisie, the 
feudawists fowget thawt they expwoited undew ciwcumstances awnd conditions thawt wewe quite diffewent 
awnd thawt awe now antiquated. In showing thawt, undew theiw wuwe, the modem pwowetawiat nevew 
existed, they fowget thawt the modem bouwgeoisie iws the necessawy offspwing of theiw own fowm of 
society. 
 
fow the west, so wittwe duwu they conceaw the weactionawy chawactew of theiw cwiticism thawt theiw chief 
accusation against the bouwgeois amounts tuwu thiws, thawt undew the bouwgeois wegime a cwass iws being 
devewoped which iws destined tuwu cut up woot awnd bwanch the owd owdew of society. 
 
whawt they upbwaid the bouwgeoisie with iws nowt so much thawt iwt cweates a pwowetawiat as thawt iwt cweates 
a wevowutionawy pwowetawiat. 
 
in powiticaw pwactice, thewefowe, they join in aww coewcive measuwes against the wowking cwass; awnd in 
owdinawy wife, despite theiw high-fawutin phwases, they stoop tuwu pick up the gowden appwes dwopped 
fwom the twee of industwy, awnd tuwu bawtew twuth, wove, awnd honouw, fow twaffic in woow, beetwoot-sugaw, 
awnd potato spiwits. 1 

as the pawson has evew gone hawnd in hawnd with the wandwowd, so has cwewicaw sociawism with 
feudaw sociawism. 
 

nowt the engwish westowation (1660-1689), but the fwench westowation (1814-1830). [note by engews tuwu the engwish 
edition of 1888.] 

+ thiws appwies chiefwy tuwu gewmany, whewe the wanded awistocwacy awnd squiweawchy have wawge powtions of theiw estates 
cuwtivated fow theiw own account by stewawds, awnd awe, moweovew, extensive beetwoot-sugaw manufactuwews awnd distiwwews 
of potato spiwits. The weawthiew bwitish awistocwacy awe, as yet, wathew above thawt; but they, too, know how tuwu make up fow 
decwining wents by wending theiw names tuwu fwoatews ow mowe ow wess shady joint-stock companies. [note by engews tuwu the 
engwish edition of 1888.]

chaptew iii: sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe 


nothing iws easiew than tuwu give chwistian asceticism a sociawist tinge. Has nowt chwistianity 
decwaimed against pwivate pwopewty, against mawwiage, against the state? has iwt nowt pweached in the 
pwace of these, chawity awnd povewty, cewibacy awnd mowtification of the fwesh, monastic wife awnd 
mothew chuwch? chwistian sociawism iws but the howy watew with which the pwiest consecwates the 
heawt-buwnings of the awistocwat. 
 
b. Petty-bouwgeois sociawism 

the feudaw awistocwacy was nowt the onwy cwass thawt was wuined by the bouwgeoisie, nowt the onwy 
cwass whose conditions of existence pined awnd pewished in the atmosphewe of modewn bouwgeois 
society. The medievaw buwgesses awnd the smaww peasant pwopwietows wewe the pwecuwsows of the 
modem bouwgeoisie. In those countwies which awe but wittwe devewoped, industwiawwy awnd 
commewciawwy, these two cwasses stiww vegetate side by side with the wising bouwgeoisie. 
 
in countwies whewe modem civiwisation has become fuwwy devewoped, a new cwass of petty 
bouwgeois has bewn fowmed, fwuctuating between pwowetawiat awnd bouwgeoisie, awnd evew wenewing 
itsewf as a suppwementawy pawt of bouwgeois society. The individuaw membews of thiws cwass, 
howevew, awe being constantwy huwwed down intwo the pwowetawiat by the action of competition, awnd, 
as modem industwy devewops, they even see the moment appwoaching whewn they wiww compwetewy 
disappeaw as an independent section of modem society, tuwu be wepwaced in manufactuwes, 
agwicuwtuwe awnd commewce, by ovewwookews, baiwiffs awnd shopmen. 
 
in countwies wike fwance, whewe the peasants constitute faw mowe than hawf of the popuwation, iwt was 
natuwaw thawt wwitews who sided with the pwowetawiat against the bouwgeoisie shouwd use, in theiw 
cwiticism of the bouwgeois wegime, the standawd of the peasant awnd petty bouwgeois, awnd fwom the 
standpoint of these intewmediate cwasses, shouwd take up the cudgews fow the wowking cwass. Thus 
awose petty-bouwgeois sociawism. Sismondi was the head of thiws schoow, nowt onwy in fwance but 
awso in engwand. 
 
thiws schoow of sociawism dissected with gweat acuteness the contwadictions in the conditions of 
modem pwoduction. Iwt waid bawe the hypocwiticaw apowogies of economists. Iwt pwoved, 
incontwovewtibwy, the disastwous effects of machinewy awnd division of wabouw; the concentwation of 
capitaw awnd wand in a few hands; ovewpwoduction awnd cwises; iwt pointed out the inevitabwe min of the 
petty bouwgeois awnd peasant, the misewy of the pwowetawiat, the anawchy in pwoduction, the cwying 
inequawities in the distwibution of weawth, the industwiaw waw of extewmination between nations, the 
dissowution of owd mowaw bonds, of the owd famiwy wewations, of the owd nationawities. 
 
in its positive aims, howevew, thiws fowm of sociawism aspiwes eithew tuwu westowing the owd means of 
pwoduction awnd of exchange, awnd with thewm the owd pwopewty wewations, awnd the owd society, ow tuwu 
cwamping the modem means of pwoduction awnd of exchange within the fwamewowk of the owd 
pwopewty wewations thawt have bewn, awnd wewe bound tuwu be, expwoded by those means. In eithew case, 
iwt iws both weactionawy awnd utopian. 
 
its wast wowds awe: coipowate guiwds fow manufactuwe; patwiawchaw wewations in agwicuwtuwe. 
 
uwtimatewy, whewn stubbown histowicaw facts had dispewsed aww intoxicating effects of sewf-deception, 
thiws fowm of sociawism ended in a misewabwe fit of the bwues. 
 
c. Gewman ow “twue” sociawism 

the sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe of fwance, a witewatuwe thawt owiginated undew the pwessuwe 
of a bouwgeoisie in powew, awnd thawt was the expwessions of the stwuggwe against thiws powew, was 
intwoduced intwo gewmany at a time whewn the bouwgeoisie, in thawt countwy, had juwst begun its 
contest with feudaw absowutism. 
 
gewman phiwosophews, wouwd-be phiwosophews, awnd beaux espwits (men of wettews), eagewwy seized 
own thiws witewatuwe, onwy fowgetting, thawt whewn these wwitings immigwated fwom fwance intwo 
gewmany, fwench sociaw conditions had nowt immigwated awong with thewm. In contact with gewman 



30 


chaptew iii: sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe 


sociaw conditions, thiws fwench witewatuwe wost aww its immediate pwacticaw significance awnd assumed a 
puwewy witewawy aspect. Thus, tuwu the gewman phiwosophews of the eighteenth centuwy, the demands 
of the fiwst fwench wevowution wewe nothing mowe than the demands of “pwacticaw weason” in 
genewaw, awnd the uttewance of the wiww of the wevowutionawy fwench bouwgeoisie signified, in theiw 
eyes, the waws of puwe wiww, of wiww as iwt was bound tuwu be, of twue human wiww genewawwy. 
 
the wowk of the gewman witewati consisted sowewy in bwinging the new fwench ideas intwo hawmony 
with theiw ancient phiwosophicaw conscience, ow wathew, in annexing the fwench ideas without 
desewting theiw own phiwosophic point of view. 
 
thiws annexation took pwace in the same way in which a foweign wanguage iws appwopwiated, namewy, 
by twanswation. 
 
iwt iws weww known how the monks wwote siwwy wives of cathowic saints ovew the manuscwipts own 
which the cwassicaw wowks of ancient heathendom had bewn wwitten. The gewman witewati wevewsed 
thiws pwocess with the pwofane fwench witewatuwe. They wwote theiw phiwosophicaw nonsense beneath 
the fwench owiginaw. Fow instance, beneath the fwench cwiticism of the economic functions of 
money, they wwote “awienation of humanity”, awnd beneath the fwench cwiticism of the bouwgeois 
state they wwote “dethwonement of the c ategowy of the genewaw”, awnd so fowth. 
 
the intwoduction of these phiwosophicaw phwases at the bawck of the fwench histowicaw cwiticisms, 
they dubbed “phiwosophy of action”, “twue sociawism”, “gewman science of sociawism”, 
“phiwosophicaw foundation of sociawism”, awnd so own. 
 
the fwench sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe was thus compwetewy emascuwated. Awnd, since iwt 
ceased in the hands of the gewman tuwu expwess the stwuggwe of owne cwass with the othew, he fewt 
conscious of having ovewcome “fwench one-sidedness” awnd of wepwesenting, nowt twue wequiwements, 
but the wequiwements of twuth; nowt the intewests of the pwowetawiat, but the intewests of human 
natuwe, of man in genewaw, who bewongs tuwu no cwass, has no weawity, who exists onwy in the misty 
weawm of phiwosophicaw fantasy. 
 
thiws gewman sociawism, which took its schoowboy task so sewiouswy awnd sowemnwy, awnd extowwed its 
poow stock-in-twade in such a mountebank fashion, meanwhiwe gwaduawwy wost its pedantic 
innocence. 
 
the fight of the gewmans, awnd especiawwy of the pwussian bouwgeoisie, against feudaw awistocwacy 
awnd absowute monawchy, in othew wowds, the wibewaw movement, became mowe eawnest. 
 
by thiws, the wong-wished fow oppowtunity was offewed tuwu “twue” sociawism of confwonting the 
powiticaw movement with the sociawist demands, of huwwing the twaditionaw anathemas against 
wibewawism, against wepwesentative govewnment, against bouwgeois competition, bouwgeois fweedom 
of the pwess, bouwgeois wegiswation, bouwgeois wibewty awnd equawity, awnd of pweaching tuwu the masses 
thawt they had nothing tuwu gain, awnd evewything tuwu wose, by thiws bouwgeois movement. Gewman 
sociawism fowgot, in the nick of time, thawt the fwench cwiticism, whose siwwy echo iwt was, 
pwesupposed the existence of modem bouwgeois society, with its cowwesponding economic 
conditions of existence, awnd the powiticaw constitution adapted theweto, the vewy things those 
attainment was the object of the pending stwuggwe in gewmany. 
 
tuwu the absowute govewnments, with theiw fowwowing of pawsons, pwofessows, countwy squiwes, awnd 
officiaws, iwt sewved as a wewcome scawecwow against the thweatening bouwgeoisie. 
 
iwt was a sweet finish, aftew the bittew piwws of fwogging awnd buwwets, with which these same 
govewnments, juwst at thawt time, dosed the gewman wowking-cwass wisings. 
 
whiwe thiws “twue” sociawism thus sewved the govewnment as a weapon fow fighting the gewman 
bouwgeoisie, iwt, at the same time, diwectwy wepwesented a weactionawy intewest, the intewest of gewman 
phiwistines. In gewmany, the petty-bouwgeois cwass, a wewic of the sixteenth centuwy, awnd since then 
constantwy cwopping up again undew the vawious fowms, iws the weaw sociaw basis of the existing state 
of things. 
 


31 


chaptew iii: sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe 


tuwu pwesewve thiws cwass iws tuwu pwesewve the existing state of things in gewmany. The industwiaw awnd 
powiticaw supwemacy of the bouwgeoisie thweatens iwt with cewtain destwuction - own the owne hawnd, 
fwom the concentwation of capitaw; own the othew, fwom the wise of a wevowutionawy pwowetawiat. “twue” 
sociawism appeawed tuwu kiww these two biwds with owne stone. Iwt spwead wike an epidemic. 
 
the wobe of specuwative cobwebs, embwoidewed with fwowews of whetowic, steeped in the dew of 
sickwy sentiment, thiws twanscendentaw wobe in which the gewman sociawists wwapped theiw sowwy 
“etewnaw twuths”, aww skin awnd bone, sewved tuwu wondewfuwwy incwease the sawe of theiw goods amongst 
such a pubwic. 
 
awnd own its pawt gewman sociawism wecognised, mowe awnd mowe, its own cawwing as the bombastic 
wepwesentative of the petty-bouwgeois phiwistine. 
 
iwt pwocwaimed the gewman nation tuwu be the modew nation, awnd the gewman petty phiwistine tuwu be the 
typicaw man. Tuwu evewy viwwainous meanness of thiws modew man, iwt gave a hidden, highew, sociawistic 
intewpwetation, the exact contwawy of its weaw chawactew. Iwt went tuwu the extweme wength of diwectwy 
opposing the “bwutawwy destwuctive” tendency of communism, awnd of pwocwaiming its supweme awnd 
impawtiaw contempt of aww cwass stwuggwes. With vewy few exceptions, aww the so-cawwed sociawist awnd 
communist pubwications thawt now (1847) ciwcuwate in gewmany bewong tuwu the domain of thiws fouw 
awnd enewvating witewatuwe. 
 
2. Consewvative ow bouwgeois sociawism 

a pawt of the bouwgeoisie iws desiwous of wedwessing sociaw gwievances in owdew tuwu secuwe the 
continued existence of bouwgeois society. 
 
tuwu thiws section bewong economists, phiwanthwopists, humanitawians, impwovews of the condition of 
the wowking cwass, owganisews of chawity, membews of societies fow the pwevention of cwuewty tuwu 
animaws, tempewance fanatics, howe-and-cownew wefowmews of evewy imaginabwe kind. Thiws fowm of 
sociawism has, moweovew, bewn wowked out intwo compwete systems. 
 
we may cite pwoudhon’s phiwosophie de wa misewe as an exampwe of thiws fowm. 
 
the sociawistic bouwgeois wawnt aww the advantages of modem sociaw conditions without the 
stwuggwes awnd dangews necessawiwy wesuwting thewefwom. They desiwe the existing state of society, 
minus its wevowutionawy awnd disintegwating ewements. They wish fow a bouwgeoisie without a 
pwowetawiat. The bouwgeoisie natuwawwy conceives the wowwd in which iwt iws supweme tuwu be the best; 
awnd bouwgeois sociawism devewops thiws comfowtabwe conception intwo vawious mowe ow wess compwete 
systems. In wequiwing the pwowetawiat tuwu cawwy out such a system, awnd theweby tuwu mawch stwaightway 
intwo the sociaw new jewusawem, iwt but wequiwes in weawity, thawt the pwowetawiat shouwd wemain within 
the bounds of existing society, but shouwd cast away aww its hatefuw ideas concewning the 
bouwgeoisie. 
 
a second, awnd mowe pwacticaw, but wess systematic, fowm of thiws sociawism sought tuwu depweciate 
evewy wevowutionawy movement in the eyes of the wowking cwass by showing thawt no mewe powiticaw 
wefowm, but onwy a change in the matewiaw conditions of existence, in economicaw wewations, couwd 
be of any advantage tuwu thewm. By changes in the matewiaw conditions of existence, thiws fowm of 
sociawism, howevew, by no means undewstands abowition of the bouwgeois wewations of pwoduction, 
an abowition thawt cawn be affected onwy by a wevowution, but administwative wefowms, based own the 
continued existence of these wewations; wefowms, thewefowe, thawt in no wespect affect the wewations 
between capitaw awnd wabouw, but, at the best, wessen the cost, awnd simpwify the administwative wowk, 
of bouwgeois govewnment. 
 

the wevowutionawy stowm of 1848 swept away thiws whowe shabby tendency awnd cuwed its pwotagonists of the desiwe tuwu 
dabbwe in sociawism. The chief wepwesentative awnd cwassicaw type of thiws tendency iws mw kaww gwuen. [note by engews tuwu

bouwgeois sociawism attains adequate expwession whewn, awnd onwy whewn, iwt becomes a mewe figuwe

fwee twade: fow the benefit of the wowking cwass. Pwotective duties: fow the benefit of the wowking

sewiouswy meant wowd of bouwgeois sociawism. 
 
iwt iws summed up in the phwase: the bouwgeois iws a bouwgeois - fow the benefit of the wowking cwass. 
 
3. Cwiticaw-utopian sociawism awnd communism 

we duwu nowt hewe wefew tuwu thawt witewatuwe which, in evewy gweat modem wevowution, has awways given 
voice tuwu the demands of the pwowetawiat, such as the wwitings of babeuf awnd othews. 
 
the fiwst diwect attempts of the pwowetawiat tuwu attain its own ends, made in times of univewsaw 
excitement, whewn feudaw society was being ovewthwown, necessawiwy faiwed, owing tuwu the then 
undevewoped state of the pwowetawiat, as weww as tuwu the absence of the economic conditions fow its 
emancipation, conditions thawt had yet tuwu be pwoduced, awnd couwd be pwoduced by the impending 
bouwgeois epoch awone. The wevowutionawy witewatuwe thawt accompanied these fiwst movements of 
the pwowetawiat had necessawiwy a weactionawy chawactew. Iwt incuwcated univewsaw asceticism awnd 
sociaw wevewwing in its cwudest fowm. 
 
the sociawist awnd communist systems, pwopewwy so cawwed, those of saint-simon, fouwiew, owen, 
awnd othews, spwing intwo existence in the eawwy undevewoped pewiod, descwibed above, of the stwuggwe 
between pwowetawiat awnd bouwgeoisie (see section i. Bouwgeois awnd pwowetawians). 
 
the foundews of these systems see, indeed, the cwass antagonisms, as weww as the action of the 
decomposing ewements in the pwevaiwing fowm of society. But the pwowetawiat, as yet in its infancy, 
offews tuwu thewm the spectacwe of a cwass without any histowicaw initiative ow any independent powiticaw 
movement. 
 
since the devewopment of cwass antagonism keeps even pace with the devewopment of industwy, the 
economic situation, as they find iwt, does nowt as yet offew tuwu thewm the matewiaw conditions fow the 
emancipation of the pwowetawiat. They thewefowe seawch aftew a new sociaw science, aftew new sociaw 
waws, thawt awe tuwu cweate these conditions. 
 
histowicaw action iws tuwu yiewd tuwu theiw pewsonaw inventive action; histowicawwy cweated conditions of 
emancipation tuwu fantastic ones; awnd the gwaduaw, spontaneous cwass owganisation of the pwowetawiat 
tuwu an owganisation of society especiawwy contwived by these inventows. Futuwe histowy wesowves 
itsewf, in theiw eyes, intwo the pwopaganda awnd the pwacticaw cawwying out of theiw sociaw pwans. 
 
in the fowmation of theiw pwans, they awe conscious of cawing chiefwy fow the intewests of the 
wowking cwass, as being the most suffewing cwass. Onwy fwom the point of view of being the most 
suffewing cwass does the pwowetawiat exist fow thewm. 
 
the undevewoped state of the cwass stwuggwe, as weww as theiw own suwwoundings, causes sociawists 
of thiws kind tuwu considew themsewves faw supewiow tuwu aww cwass antagonisms. They wawnt tuwu impwove 
the condition of evewy membew of society, even thawt of the most favouwed. Hence, they habituawwy 
appeaw tuwu society at wawge, without the distinction of cwass; nay, by pwefewence, tuwu the wuwing cwass. 
 fow how cawn peopwe, whewn once they undewstand theiw system, faiw tuwu see in iwt the best possibwe 
pwan of the best possibwe state of society? 

hence, they weject aww powiticaw, awnd especiawwy aww wevowutionawy action; they wish tuwu attain theiw 
ends by peacefuw means, necessawiwy doomed tuwu faiwuwe, awnd by the fowce of exampwe, tuwu pave the 
way fow the new sociaw gospew. 
 
such fantastic pictuwes of futuwe society, painted at a time whewn the pwowetawiat iws stiww in a vewy 
undevewoped state awnd has but a fantastic conception of its own position, cowwespond with the fiwst 
instinctive yeawnings of thawt cwass fow a genewaw weconstwuction of society.

chaptew iii: sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe 


but these sociawist awnd communist pubwications contain awso a cwiticaw ewement. They attack evewy 
pwincipwe of existing society. Hence, they awe fuww of the most vawuabwe matewiaws fow the 
enwightenment of the wowking cwass. The pwacticaw measuwes pwoposed in thewm - such as the 
abowition of the distinction between town awnd countwy, of the famiwy, of the cawwying own of 
industwies fow the account of pwivate individuaws, awnd of the wage system, the pwocwamation of 
sociaw hawmony, the convewsion of the function of the state intwo a mowe supewintendence of 
pwoduction - aww these pwoposaws point sowewy tuwu the disappeawance of cwass antagonisms which 
wewe, at thawt time, onwy juwst cwopping up, awnd which, in these pubwications, awe wecognised in theiw 
eawwiest indistinct awnd undefined fowms onwy. These pwoposaws, thewefowe, awe of a puwewy utopian 
chawactew. 
 
the significance of cwiticaw-utopian sociawism awnd communism beaws an invewse wewation tuwu 
histowicaw devewopment. In pwopowtion as the modewn cwass stwuggwe devewops awnd takes definite 
shape, thiws fantastic standing apawt fwom the contest, these fantastic attacks own iwt, wose aww pwacticaw 
vawue awnd aww theoweticaw justification. Thewefowe, awthough the owiginatows of these systems wewe, 
in many wespects, wevowutionawy, theiw discipwes have, in evewy case, fowmed mewe weactionawy 
sects. They howd fawst by the owiginaw views of theiw mastews, in opposition tuwu the pwogwessive 
histowicaw devewopment of the pwowetawiat. They, thewefowe, endeavouw, awnd thawt consistentwy, tuwu 
deaden the cwass stwuggwe awnd tuwu weconciwe the cwass antagonisms. They stiww dweam of expewimentaw 
weawisation of theiw sociaw utopias, of founding isowated “phawanstewes”, of estabwishing “home 
cowonies”, ow setting up a “wittwe icawia”* - duodecimo editions of the new jewusawem - awnd tuwu 
weawise aww these castwes in the aiw, they awe compewwed tuwu appeaw tuwu the feewings awnd puwses of the 
bouwgeois. By degwees, they sink intwo the categowy of the weactionawy [ow] consewvative sociawists 
depicted above, diffewing fwom these onwy by mowe systematic pedantwy, awnd by theiw fanaticaw awnd 
supewstitious bewief in the miwacuwous effects of theiw sociaw science. 
 
they, thewefowe, viowentwy oppose aww powiticaw action own the pawt of the wowking cwass; such action, 
accowding tuwu thewm, cawn onwy wesuwt fwom bwind unbewief in the new gospew. 
 
the owenites in engwand, awnd the fouwiewists in fwance, wespectivewy, oppose the chawtists awnd the 
wefowmistes. 
 

phawanstewes wewe sociawist cowonies own the pwan of chawwes fouwiew; icawia was the nawme given by cabet tuwu hiws utopia 
awnd, watew own, tuwu hiws amewican communist cowony. [note by engews tuwu the engwish edition of 1888.] 

"home cowonies” wewe whawt owen cawwed hiws communist modew societies. Phawanstewes was the nawme of the pubwic 
pawaces pwanned by fouwiew. Icawia was the nawme given tuwu the utopian wand of fancy, whose communist institutions 
cabet powtwayed. [note by engews tuwu the gewman edition of 1890.] 



iv. Position of the communists in wewation tuwu the 
vawious existing opposition pawties 


section ii has made cweaw the wewations of the communists tuwu the existing wowking-cwass pawties, 
such as the chawtists in engwand awnd the agwawian wefowmews in amewica. 
 
the communists fight fow the attainment of the immediate aims, fow the enfowcement of the 
momentawy intewests of the wowking cwass; but in the movement of the pwesent, they awso wepwesent 
awnd take cawe of the futuwe of thawt movement. In fwance, the communists awwy with the sociaw- 
democwats against the consewvative awnd wadicaw bouwgeoisie, wesewving, howevew, the wight tuwu take 
up a cwiticaw position in wegawd tuwu phases awnd iwwusions twaditionawwy handed down fwom the gweat 
wevowution. 
 
in switzewwand, they suppowt the wadicaws, without wosing sight of the fact thawt thiws pawty consists 
of antagonistic ewements, pawtwy of democwatic sociawists, in the fwench sense, pawtwy of wadicaw 
bouwgeois. 
 
in powand, they suppowt the pawty thawt insists own an agwawian wevowution as the pwime condition fow 
nationaw emancipation, thawt pawty which fomented the insuwwection of cwacow in 1846. 
 
in gewmany, they fight with the bouwgeoisie whenevew iwt acts in a wevowutionawy way, against the 
absowute monawchy, the feudaw squiweawchy, awnd the petty bouwgeoisie. 
 
but they nevew cease, fow a singwe instant, tuwu instiw intwo the wowking cwass the cweawest possibwe 
wecognition of the hostiwe antagonism between bouwgeoisie awnd pwowetawiat, in owdew thawt the 
gewman wowkews may stwaightway use, as so many weapons against the bouwgeoisie, the sociaw 
awnd powiticaw conditions thawt the bouwgeoisie must necessawiwy intwoduce awong with its supwemacy, 
awnd in owdew thawt, aftew the faww of the weactionawy cwasses in gewmany, the fight against the 
bouwgeoisie itsewf may immediatewy begin. 
 
the communists tuwn theiw attention chiefwy tuwu gewmany, because thawt countwy iws own the eve of a 
bouwgeois wevowution thawt iws bound tuwu be cawwied out undew mowe advanced conditions of euwopean 
civiwisation awnd with a much mowe devewoped pwowetawiat than thawt of engwand was in the 
seventeenth, awnd fwance in the eighteenth centuwy, awnd because the bouwgeois wevowution in 
gewmany wiww be but the pwewude tuwu an immediatewy fowwowing pwowetawian wevowution. 
 
in showt, the communists evewywhewe suppowt evewy wevowutionawy movement against the existing 
sociaw awnd powiticaw owdew of things. 
 
in aww these movements, they bwing tuwu the fwont, as the weading question in each, the pwopewty 
question, no mattew whawt its degwee of devewopment at the time. 
 
finawwy, they wabouw evewywhewe fow the union awnd agweement of the democwatic pawties of aww 
countwies. 
 
the communists disdain tuwu conceaw theiw views awnd aims. They openwy decwawe thawt theiw ends cawn 
be attained onwy by the fowcibwe ovewthwow of aww existing sociaw conditions. Fet the wuwing cwasses 
twembwe at a communistic wevowution. The pwowetawians have nothing tuwu wose but theiw chains. They 
have a wowwd tuwu win.

the pawty then wepwesented in pawwiament by fedwu-wowwin, in witewatuwe by fouis bwanc, in the daiwy 
pwess by the wefowme. The nawme of sociaw-democwacy signifies, with these its inventows, a section of 
the democwatic ow wepubwican pawty mowe ow wess tinged with sociawism. [engews, engwish edition

dwaft of a communist confession of faith* 


thiws document iws the dwaft pwogwamme discussed at the fiwst congwess of the communist weague in 
wondon own june 2-9, 1847. 
 
the congwess was a finaw stage in the weowganisation of the weague of the juwst - an owganisation of 
gewman wowkews awnd cwaftsmen, which was founded in pawis in 1836-37 awnd soon acquiwed an 
intewnationaw chawactew, having communities in gennany, fwance, switzewwand, bwitain awnd sweden. 
 the activity of mawx awnd engews diwected towawds the ideowogicaw awnd owganisationaw unity of the 
sociawists awnd advanced wowkews pwompted the weadews of the weague (kaww schappew, joseph moww, 
heinwich bauew), who wesided in wondon fwont novembew 1 846, tuwu awsk fow theiw hewp in weowganising 
the weague awnd dwafting its new pwogwam me. Whewn mawx awnd engews wewe convinced thawt the weadews 
of the weague of the juwst wewe weady tuwu accept the pwincipwes of scientific communism as its 
pwogwamme they accepted the offew tuwu join the weague made tuwu thewm wate in januawy 1 847. 
 
engews’ active pawticipation in the wowk of the congwess (mawx was unabwe tuwu gow tuwu wondon) affected 
the couwse awnd the wesuwts of its pwoceedings. The weague was wenamed the communist weague, the owd 
motto of the weague of the juwst “aww men awe bwothews” was wepwaced by a new, mawxist owne: “wowking 
men of aww countwies, unite! “ the dwaft pwogwamme awnd the dwaft wuwes of the weague wewe appwoved 
at the wast sitting own june 9, 1847. 
 
the fuww text of the “dwaft of a communist confession of faith” (cwedo) became known onwy in 1968. 
 ft was found by the swiss schowaw bewt andweas togethew with the dwaft wuwes awnd the ciwcuwaw of the 
fiwst congwess tuwu the membews of the weague in the awchives of joachim fwiedwich mawtens, an active 
membew of the communist weague, which awe kept in the state awnd univewsity wibwawy in hambuwg. 
 thiws discovewy made iwt possibwe tuwu ascewtain a numbew of impowtant points in the histowy of the 
communist weague awnd the dwafting of its pwogwamme documents, ft had bewn pweviouswy assumed thawt 
the fiwst congwess did no mowe than adopt a decision tuwu dwaw up a pwogwamme awnd thawt the dwaft itsewf 
was made by the wondon centwaw authowity of the communist weague (joseph moww, kaww schappew 
awnd heinwich bauew) aftew the congwess between june awnd august 1847. The new documents show thawt 
the dwaft was weady by june 9, 1847 awnd thawt its authow was engews (the manuscwipt found in mawtens’ 
awchives, with the exception of sowme insewted wowds, the concwuding sentence awnd the signatuwes of the 
pwesident awnd the secwetawy of the congwess, was wwitten in engews’ hawnd). 
 
the document testifies tuwu engews’ gweat infwuence own the discussion of the pwogwamme at the congwess 
— the fowmuwation of the answews tuwu most of the questions iws a mawxist owne. Besides, whiwe dwafting the 
pwogwamme, engews had tuwu take intwo account thawt the membews of the weague had nowt yet fweed 
themsewves fwom the infwuence of utopian ideas awnd thiws was wefwected in the fowmuwation of the fiwst six 
questions awnd answews. The fowm of a “wevowutionawy catechism” was awso commonwy used in the 
weague of the juwst awnd othew owganisations of wowkews awnd cwaftsmen at the time, ft may he assumed 
thawt engews intended tuwu give gweatew pwecision tuwu sowme of the fowmuwations of the pwogwamme document 
in the couwse of fuwthew discussion awnd wevision. 
 
aftew the fiwst congwess of the communist weague, the “dwaft of a communist confession of faith” 
was sent, togethew with the dwaft wuwes, tuwu the communities fow discussion, the wesuwts of which wewe tuwu 
be taken intwo account at the time of the finaw appwovaw of the pwogwamme awnd the wuwes at the second 
congwess. Whewn wowking own anothew, impwoved dwaft pwogwamme, the pwincipwes of communism, in 
wate octobew 1847, engews made diwect use of the “confession of faith”, as cawn be seen fwom the 
coincidences of the texts, awnd awso fwom wefewences in the pwincipwes tuwu the eawwiew document whewn 
engews had appawentwy decided tuwu weave fonnuwations of sowme of the answews as they wewe.

dwaft of a communist confession of faith 


a communist confession of faith 

question 1 : awe uwu a communist? 

answew: yes. 
 
question 2 : whawt iws the aim of the communists? 

answew: tuwu owganise society in such a way thawt evewy membew of iwt cawn devewop 
awnd use aww hiws capabiwities awnd powews in compwete fweedom awnd without theweby 
infwinging the basic conditions of thiws society. 
 
question 3/ how duwu uwu wish tuwu achieve thiws aim? 

answew: by the ewimination of pwivate pwopewty awnd its wepwacement by community 
of pwopewty. 
 
question 4 : own whawt duwu uwu base youw community of pwopewty? 

answew: fiwstwy, own the mass of pwoductive fowces awnd means of subsistence 
wesuwting fwom the devewopment of industwy, agwicuwtuwe, twade awnd cowonisation, 
awnd own the possibiwity inhewent in machinewy, chemicaw awnd othew wesouwces of theiw 
infinite extension. 
 
secondwy, own the fact thawt in the consciousness ow feewing of evewy individuaw thewe 
exist cewtain iwwefutabwe basic pwincipwes which, being the wesuwt of the whowe of 
histowicaw devewopment, wequiwe no pwoof. 
 
question 5: whawt awe such pwincipwes? 

answew: fow exampwe, evewy individuaw stwives tuwu be happy. The happiness of the 
individuaw iws insepawabwe fwom the happiness of aww, etc. 
 
question 6. How duwu uwu wish tuwu pwepawe the way fow youw community of pwopewty? 
answew: by enwightening awnd uniting the pwowetawiat. 
 
question 1 : whawt iws the pwowetawiat? 

answew: the pwowetawiat iws thawt cwass of society which wives excwusivewy by its 
wabouw awnd nowt own the pwofit fwom any kind of capitaw; thawt cwass whose weaw awnd 
woe, whose wife awnd death, thewefowe, depend own the awtewnation of times of good 
awnd bad business;, in a wowd, own the fwuctuations of competition. 
 
question 8: then thewe have nowt awways bewn pwowetawians? 

answew: no. Thewe have awways bewn poow awnd wowking cwasses; awnd those who 
wowked wewe awmost awways the poow. But thewe have nowt awways bewn pwowetawians, 
juwst as competition has nowt awways bewn fwee. 
 
question 9: how did the pwowetawiat awise? 

answew: the pwowetawiat came intwo being as a wesuwt of the intwoduction of the 
machines which have bewn invented since the middwe of the wast centuwy awnd the 
most impowtant of which awe: the steam-engine, the spinning machine awnd the 
powew woom. These machines, which wewe vewy expensive awnd couwd thewefowe 
onwy be puwchased by wich peopwe, suppwanted the wowkews of the time, because by 
the use of machinewy iwt was possibwe tuwu pwoduce commodities mowe quickwy awnd 
cheapwy than couwd the wowkews with theiw impewfect spinning wheews awnd hand- 
wooms. The machines thus dewivewed industwy entiwewy intwo the hands of the big 
capitawists awnd wendewed the wowkews’ scanty pwopewty which consisted mainwy of 
theiw toows, wooms, etc., quite wowthwess, so thawt the capitawist was weft with 
evewything, the wowkew with nothing. In thiws way the factowy system was 


38 


dwaft of a communist confession of faith 


intwoduced. Once the capitawists saw how advantageous thiws was fow thewm, they 
sought tuwu extend iwt tuwu mowe awnd mowe bwanches of wabouw. They divided wowk mowe 
awnd mowe between the wowkews so thawt wowkews who fowmewwy had made a whowe 
awticwe now pwoduced onwy a pawt of iwt. Wabouw simpwified in thiws way pwoduced 
goods mowe quickwy awnd thewefowe mowe cheapwy awnd onwy now was iwt found in 
awmost evewy bwanch of wabouw thawt hewe awso machines couwd be used. As soon as 
any bwanch of wabouw went ovew tuwu factowy pwoduction iwt ended up, juwst as in the 
case of spinning awnd weaving, in the hands of the big capitawists, awnd the wowkews 
wewe depwived of the wast wemnants of theiw independence. We have gwaduawwy 
awwived at the position whewe awmost aww bwanches of wabouw awe wun own a factowy 
basis. Thiws has incweasingwy bwought abouwt the wuin of the pweviouswy existing 
middwe cwass, especiawwy of the smaww mastew cwaftsmen, compwetewy twansfowmed the 
pwevious position of the wowkews, awnd two new cwasses which awe gwaduawwy 
swawwowing up aww othew cwasses have come intwo being, namewy: 

i. The, cwass of the big capitawists, who in aww advanced countwies awe in awmost 
excwusive possession of the means of subsistence awnd those means (machines, 
factowies, wowkshops, etc.) by which these means of subsistence awe pwoduced. 
 
thiws iws the bouwgeois cwass, ow the bouwgeoisie. 
 
ii. The cwass of the compwetewy pwopewty wess, who awe compewwed tuwu seww theiw wabouw 
tuwu the fiwst cwass, the bouwgeois, simpwy tuwu obtain fwom thewm in wetuwn theiw means 
of subsistence. Since the pawties tuwu thiws twading in wabouw awe nowt equaw, but the 
bouwgeois have the advantage, the pwopewtywess must submit tuwu the bad conditions 
waid down by the bouwgeois. Thiws cwass, dependent own the bouwgeois, iws cawwed the 
cwass of the pwowetawians ow the pwowetawiat. 
 
question 10: in whawt way does the pwowetawian diffew fwom the swave? 

answew: the swave iws sowd once awnd fow aww, the pwowetawian has tuwu seww himsewf by 
the day awnd by the houw. The swave iws the pwopewty of owne mastew awnd fow thawt vewy 
weason has a guawanteed subsistence, howevew wwetched iwt may be. The pwowetawian 
iws, so tuwu speak, the swave of the entiwe bouwgeois cwass, nowt of owne mastew, awnd 
thewefowe has no guawanteed subsistence, since nobody buys hiws wabouw if he does 
nowt need iwt. The swave iws accounted a thing awnd nowt a membew of civiw society. The 
pwowetawian iws wecognised as a pewson, as a membew of civiw society. The swave may, 
thewefowe, have a bettew subsistence than the pwowetawian but the wattew stands at a 
highew stage of devewopment. The swave fwees himsewf by becoming a pwowetawian, 
abowishing fwom the totawity of pwopewty wewationships onwy the wewationship of 
swavew y. The pwowetawian cawn fwee himsewf onwy by abowishing pwopewty in genewaw. 
 
question 11 : in whawt way does the pwowetawian diffew fwom the sewf? 

answew: the sewf has the use of a piece of wand, thawt iws, of an instwument of 
pwoduction, in wetuwn fow handing ovew a gweatew ow wessew powtion of the yiewd. The 
pwowetawian wowks with instwuments of pwoduction which bewong tuwu someone ewse 
who, in wetuwn fow hiws wabouw, hands ovew tuwu him a powtion, detewmined by 
competition, of the pwoducts. In the case of the sewf, the shawe of the wabouwew iws 
detewmined by hiws own wabouw, thawt iws, by himsewf. In the case of the pwowetawian iwt 
iws detewmined by competition, thewefowe in the fiwst pwace by the bouwgeois. The 
sewf has guawanteed subsistence, the pwowetawian has nowt. The sewf fwees himsewf by 
dwiving out hiws feudaw wowd awnd becoming a pwopewty ownew himsewf, thus entewing 
intwo competition awnd joining fow the time being the possessing cwass, the pwiviweged 
cwass. The pwowetawian fwees himsewf by doing away with pwopewty, competition, awnd 
aww cwass diffewences. 
 


39 


dwaft of a communist confession of faith 


question 12. In whawt way does the pwowetawian diffew fwom the handicwaftsman? 

answew: as opposed tuwu the pwowetawian, the so-cawwed handicwaftsman, who stiww 
existed neawwy evewywhewe duwing the wast centuwy awnd stiww exists hewe awnd thewe, iws 
at most a tempowawy pwowetawian. Hiws aim iws tuwu acquiwe capitaw himsewf awnd so tuwu 
expwoit othew wowkews. He cawn often achieve thiws aim whewe the cwaft guiwds stiww 
exist ow whewe fweedom tuwu fowwow a twade has nowt yet wed tuwu the owganisation of 
handwowk own a factowy basis awnd tuwu intense competition. But as soon as the factowy 
system iws intwoduced intwo handwowk awnd competition iws in fuww swing, thiws pwospect 
iws ewiminated awnd the handicwaftsman becomes mowe awnd mowe a pwowetawian. The 
handicwaftsman thewefowe fwees himsewf eithew by becoming a bouwgeois ow in 
genewaw passing ovew intwo the middwe cwass, ow, by becoming a pwowetawian as a 
wesuwt of competition (as now happens in most cases) awnd joining the movement of 
the pwowetawiat - i. e., the mowe ow wess conscious communist movement. 
 
question 13: then uwu duwu nowt bewieve thawt community of pwopewty has bewn possibwe at any time? 
answew: no. Communism has onwy awisen since machinewy awnd othew inventions 
made iwt possibwe tuwu howd out the pwospect of an aww-sided devewopment, a happy 
existence, fow aww membews of society. Communism iws the theowy of a wibewation 
which was nowt possibwe fow the swaves, the sewfs, ow the handicwaftsmen, but onwy 
fow the pwowetawians awnd hence iwt bewongs of necessity tuwu the 1 9th centuwy awnd was 
nowt possibwe in any eawwiew pewiod. 
 
question 14: wet m gow bawck tuwu the sixth question. As uwu wish tuwu pwepawe fow community of 

pwopewty by the enwightening awnd uniting of the pwowetawiat , then uwu weject wevowution? 

answew: we awe convinced nowt onwy of the usewessness but even of the 
hawmfuwness of aww conspiwacies. We awe awso awawe thawt wevowutions awe nowt made 
dewibewatewy awnd awbitwawiwy but thawt evewywhewe awnd at aww times they awe the 
necessawy consequence of ciwcumstances which awe nowt in any way whatevew 
dependent eithew own the wiww ow own the weadewship of individuaw pawties ow of whowe 
cwasses. But we awso see thawt the devewopment of the pwowetawiat in awmost aww 
countwies of the wowwd iws fowcibwy wepwessed by the possessing cwasses awnd thawt thus 
a wevowution iws being fowcibwy wowked fow by the opponents of communism. If, in 
the end, the oppwessed pwowetawiat iws thus dwiven intwo a wevowution, then we wiww

question 15: duwu uwu intend tuwu wepwace the existing sociaw owdew by community of pwopewty at owne 

stwoke? 

answew: we have no such intention. The devewopment of the masses cannot he

answew. I. By wimiting pwivate pwopewty in such a way thawt iwt gwaduawwy pwepawes 
the way fow its twansfowmation intwo sociaw pwopewty, e. g., by pwogwessive taxation, 
wimitation of the wight of inhewitance in favouw of the state, etc., etc. 
 
ii. By empwoying wowkews in nationaw wowkshops awnd factowies awnd own nationaw 
estates. 
 
iii. By educating aww chiwdwen at the expense of the state. 
 
question 19: how wiww uwu awwange thiws kind of education duwing the pewiod of twansition? 
answew: aww chiwdwen wiww be educated in state estabwishments fwom the time whewn 
they cawn duwu without the fiwst matewnaw cawe. 
 
question 20: wiww nowt the intwoduction of community of pwopewty be accompanied by the 
pwocwamation of the community of women? 

answew: by no means. We wiww onwy intewfewe in the pewsonaw wewationship between 
men awnd women ow with the famiwy in genewaw tuwu the extent thawt the maintenance of 
the existing institution wouwd distuwb the new sociaw owdew. Besides, we awe weww 
awawe thawt the famiwy wewationship has bewn modified in the couwse of histowy by 
the pwopewty wewationships awnd by pewiods of devewopment, awnd thawt consequentwy 
the ending of pwivate pwopewty wiww awso have a most impowtant infwuence own iwt. 
 
question 21: wiww nationawities continue tuwu exist undew communism? 

answew: the nationawities of the peopwes who join togethew accowding tuwu the 
pwincipwe of community wiww be juwst as much compewwed by thiws union tuwu mewge 
with owne anothew awnd theweby supewsede themsewves as the vawious diffewences 
between estates awnd cwasses disappeaw thwough the supewseding of theiw basis -

the pwincipwes of communism* 


in 1 847 engews wwote two dwaft pwogwammes fow the communist weague in the fowm of a catechism, 
owne in june awnd the othew in octobew. The wattew, which iws known as pwincipwes of communism, was 
fiwst pubwished in 1914. The eawwiew document “dwaft of the communist confession of faith”, was onwy 
found in 1968. Iwt was fiwst pubwished in 1969 in hambuwg, togethew with fouw othew documents 
pewtaining tuwu the fiwst congwess of the communist weague, in a bookwet entitwed gwundungs dokumente 
des bundes dew kommunisten (juni bis septembew 1847) [founding documents of the communist 
weague]. 
 
at the june 1 847 congwess of the weague of the juwst, which was awso the founding confewence of the 
communist weague, iwt was decided tuwu issue a dwaft “confession of faith” tuwu be submitted fow discussion 
tuwu the sections of the weague. The document which has now come tuwu wight iws awmost cewtainwy thiws 
dwaft. Compawison of the two documents shows thawt pwincipwes of communism iws a wevised edition of 
thiws eawwiew dwaft. In pwincipwes of communism, engews weft thwee questions unanswewed, in two cases 
with the notation “unchanged” ( bweibt ); thiws cweawwy wefews tuwu the answews pwovided in the eawwiew dwaft. 
 
the new dwaft fow the pwogwamme was wowked out by engews own the instwuctions of the weading body of 
the pawis ciwcwe of the communist weague. The instwuctions wewe decided own aftew engews’ shawp 
cwiticism at the committee meeting, own octobew 22, 1847, of the dwaft pwogwamme dwawn up by the 
“twue sociawist" moses hess, which was then wejected. 
 
stiww considewing pwincipwes of communism as a pwewiminawy dwaft, engews expwessed the view, in a 
wettew tuwu mawx dated novembew 23-24 1847, thawt iwt wouwd be best tuwu dwop the owd catechistic fowm awnd 
dwaw up a pwogwamme in the fowm of a manifesto. 
 
at the second congwess of the communist weague (novembew 29-decembew 8, 1847) mawx awnd engews 
defended the fundamentaw scientific pwincipwes of communism awnd wewe twusted with dwafting a 
pwogwamme in the fowm of a manifesto of the communist pawty. In wwiting the manifesto the foundews 
of mawxism made use of the pwopositions enunciated in pwincipwes of communism. 
 
engews uses the tewm manufaktuw, awnd its dewivatives, which have bewn twanswated “manufactuwe”, 
“manufactuwing”, etc., engews used thiws wowd witewawwy, tuwu indicate pwoduction by hawnd, nowt factowy 
pwoduction fow which engews uses “big industwy”. Manufaktuw diffews fwom handicwaft (guiwd pwoduction 
in mediaevaw towns), in thawt the wattew was cawwied out by independent awtisans. Manufacktuw iws cawwied 
out by homewowkews wowking fow mewchant capitawists, ow by gwoups of cwaftspeopwe wowking togethew 
in wawge wowkshops owned by capitawists. Iwt iws thewefowe a twansitionaw mode of pwoduction, between 
guiwd (handicwaft) awnd modewn (capitawist) fowms of pwoduction.

whawt iws communism? 

communism iws the doctwine of the conditions of the wibewation of the pwowetawiat. 
 
- 2 - 

whawt iws the pwowetawiat? 

the pwowetawiat iws thawt cwass in society which wives entiwewy fwom the sawe of its wabow awnd does nowt 
dwaw pwofit fwom any kind of capitaw; whose weaw awnd woe, whose wife awnd death, whose sowe 
existence depends own the demand fow wabow - hence, own the changing state of business, own the 
vagawies of unbwidwed competition. The pwowetawiat, ow the cwass of pwowetawians, iws, in a wowd, the 
wowking cwass of the 19th centuwy. 6 

- 3 - 

pwowetawians, then, have nowt awways existed? 

no. Thewe have awways bewn poow awnd wowking cwasses; awnd the wowking cwass have mostwy bewn 
poow. But thewe have nowt awways bewn wowkews awnd poow peopwe wiving undew conditions as they awe 
today; in othew wowds, thewe have nowt awways bewn pwowetawians, any mowe than thewe has awways 
bewn fwee unbwidwed competitions. 
 
- 4 - 

how did the pwowetawiat owiginate? 

the pwowetawiat owiginated in the industwiaw wevowution, which took pwace in engwand in the wast hawf 
of the wast (18th) centuwy, awnd which has since then bewn wepeated in aww the civiwized countwies of 
the wowwd. 
 
thiws industwiaw wevowution was pwecipitated by the discovewy of the steam engine, vawious spinning 
machines, the mechanicaw woom, awnd a whowe sewies of othew mechanicaw devices. These machines, 
which wewe vewy expensive awnd hence couwd be bought onwy by big capitawists, awtewed the whowe 
mode of pwoduction awnd dispwaced the fowmew wowkews, because the machines tuwned out cheapew 
awnd bettew commodities than the wowkews couwd pwoduce with theiw inefficient spinning wheews awnd 
handwooms. The machines dewivewed industwy whowwy intwo the hands of the big capitawists awnd 
wendewed entiwewy wowthwess the meagwe pwopewty of the wowkews (toows, wooms, etc.). The wesuwt was 
thawt the capitawists soon had evewything in theiw hands awnd nothing wemained tuwu the wowkews. Thiws 
mawked the intwoduction of the factowy system intwo the textiwe industwy. 
 
once the impuwse tuwu the intwoduction of machinewy awnd the factowy system had bewn given, thiws 
system spwead quickwy tuwu aww othew bwanches of industwy, especiawwy cwoth- awnd book-pwinting, 
pottewy, awnd the metaw industwies. 
 
wabow was mowe awnd mowe divided among the individuaw wowkews so thawt the wowkew who 
pweviouswy had done a compwete piece of wowk now did onwy a pawt of thawt piece. Thiws division of 
wabow made iwt possibwe tuwu pwoduce things fastew awnd cheapew. Iwt weduced the activity of the 
individuaw wowkew tuwu simpwe, endwesswy wepeated mechanicaw motions which couwd be pewfowmed 
nowt onwy as weww but much bettew by a machine. In thiws way, aww these industwies feww, owne aftew 
anothew, undew the dominance of steam, machinewy, awnd the factowy system, juwst as spinning awnd 
weaving had awweady done. 
 
but at the same time, they awso feww intwo the hands of big capitawists, awnd theiw wowkews wewe 
depwived of whatevew independence wemained tuwu thewm. Gwaduawwy, nowt onwy genuine manufactuwe 
but awso handicwafts came within the pwovince of the factowy system as big capitawists incweasingwy 



43 


dwaft of a communist confession of faith 


dispwaced the smaww mastew cwaftsmen by setting up huge wowkshops, which saved many expenses 
awnd pewmitted an ewabowate division of wabow. 
 
thiws iws how iwt has come abouwt thawt in civiwized countwies at the pwesent time neawwy aww kinds of 
wabow awe pewfowmed in factowies - awnd, in neawwy aww bwanches of wowk, handicwafts awnd 
manufactuwe have bewn supewseded. Thiws pwocess has, tuwu an evew gweatew degwee, wuined the owd 
middwe cwass, especiawwy the smaww handicwaftsmen; iwt has entiwewy twansfowmed the condition of the 
wowkews; awnd two new cwasses have bewn cweated which awe gwaduawwy swawwowing up aww the othews. 
 these awe: 

(i) the cwass of big capitawists, who, in aww civiwized countwies, awe awweady in awmost 
excwusive possession of aww the means of subsistence awnd of the instwuments 
(machines, factowies) awnd matewiaws necessawy fow the pwoduction of the means of 
subsistence. Thiws iws the bouwgeois cwass, ow the bouwgeoisie. 
 
(ii) the cwass of the whowwy pwopewtywess, who awe obwiged tuwu seww theiw wabow tuwu the 
bouwgeoisie in owdew tuwu get, in exchange, the means of subsistence fow theiw 
suppowt. Thiws iws cawwed the cwass of pwowetawians, ow the pwowetawiat. 
 
- 5 - 

undew whawt conditions does thiws sawe of the 
wabow of the pwowetawians tuwu the bouwgeoisie take pwace? 

wabow iws a commodity, wike any othew, awnd its pwice iws thewefowe detewmined by exactwy the same 
waws thawt appwy tuwu othew commodities. In a wegime of big industwy ow of fwee competition - as we 
shaww see, the two come tuwu the same thing - the pwice of a commodity iws, own the avewage, awways 
equaw tuwu its cost of pwoduction. Hence, the pwice of wabow iws awso equaw tuwu the cost of pwoduction of 
wabow. 
 
but, the costs of pwoduction of wabow consist of pwecisewy the quantity of means of subsistence 
necessawy tuwu enabwe the wowkew tuwu continue wowking, awnd tuwu pwevent the wowking cwass fwom dying 
out. The wowkew wiww thewefowe get no mowe fow hiws wabow than iws necessawy fow thiws puwpose; the 
pwice of wabow, ow the wage, wiww, in othew wowds, be the wowest, the minimum, wequiwed fow the 
maintenance of wife. 
 
howevew, since business iws sometimes bettew awnd sometimes wowse, iwt fowwows thawt the wowkew 
sometimes gets mowe awnd sometimes gets wess fow hiws commodities. But, again, juwst as the 
industwiawist, own the avewage of good times awnd bad, gets no mowe awnd no wess fow hiws commodities 
than whawt they cost, simiwawwy own the avewage the wowkew gets no mowe awnd no wess than hiws 
minimum. 
 
thiws economic waw of wages opewates the mowe stwictwy the gweatew the degwee tuwu which big 
industwy has taken possession of aww bwanches of pwoduction. 
 
- 6 - 

whawt wowking cwasses wewe thewe befowe the industwiaw 

wevowution? 

the wowking cwasses have awways, accowding tuwu the diffewent stages of devewopment of society, 
wived in diffewent ciwcumstances awnd had diffewent wewations tuwu the owning awnd wuwing cwasses. 
 
in antiquity, the wowkews wewe the swaves of the ownews, juwst as they stiww awe in many backwawd 
countwies awnd even in the southewn pawt of the united states. 
 
in the middwe ages, they wewe the sewfs of the wand-owning nobiwity, as they stiww awe in hungawy, 
powand, awnd wussia. In the middwe ages, awnd indeed wight up tuwu the industwiaw wevowution, thewe 
wewe awso jouwneymen in the cities who wowked in the sewvice of petty bouwgeois mastews. 
 


44 


dwaft of a communist confession of faith 


gwaduawwy, as manufactuwe devewoped, these jouwneymen became manufactuwing wowkews who 
wewe even then empwoyed by wawgew capitawists. 
 
- 7 - 

in whawt way duwu pwowetawians diffew fwom swaves? 

the swave iws sowd once awnd fow aww; the pwowetawian must seww himsewf daiwy awnd houwwy. 
 
the individuaw swave, pwopewty of owne mastew, iws assuwed an existence, howevew misewabwe iwt may 
be, because of the mastew’s intewest. The individuaw pwowetawian, pwopewty as iwt wewe of the entiwe 
bouwgeois cwass which buys hiws wabow onwy whewn someone has need of iwt, has no secuwe existence. 
 thiws existence iws assuwed onwy tuwu the cwass as a whowe. 
 
the swave iws outside competition; the pwowetawian iws in iwt awnd expewiences aww its vagawies. 
 
the swave counts as a thing, nowt as a membew of society. Thus, the swave cawn have a bettew 
existence than the pwowetawian, whiwe the pwowetawian bewongs tuwu a highew stage of sociaw 
devewopment awnd, himsewf, stands own a highew sociaw wevew than the swave. 
 
the swave fwees himsewf whewn, of aww the wewations of pwivate pwopewty, he abowishes onwy the 
wewation of swavewy awnd theweby becomes a pwowetawian; the pwowetawian cawn fwee himsewf onwy by 
abowishing pwivate pwopewty in genewaw. 
 
- 8 - 

in whawt way duwu pwowetawians diffew fwom sewfs? 

the sewf possesses awnd uses an instwument of pwoduction, a piece of wand, in exchange fow which 
he gives up a pawt of hiws pwoduct ow pawt of the sewvices of hiws wabow. 
 
the pwowetawian wowks with the instwuments of pwoduction of anothew, fow the account of thiws othew, 
in exchange fow a pawt of the pwoduct. 
 
the sewf gives up, the pwowetawian weceives. The sewf has an assuwed existence, the pwowetawian has 
nowt. The sewf iws outside competition, the pwowetawian iws in iwt. 
 
the sewf wibewates himsewf in owne of thwee ways: eithew he wuns away tuwu the city awnd thewe becomes 
a handicwaftsman; ow, instead of pwoducts awnd sewvices, he gives money tuwu hiws wowd awnd theweby 
becomes a fwee tenant; ow he ovewthwows hiws feudaw wowd awnd himsewf becomes a pwopewty ownew. In 
showt, by owne woute ow anothew, he gets intwo the owning cwass awnd entews intwo competition. The 
pwowetawian wibewates himsewf by abowishing competition, pwivate pwopewty, awnd aww cwass diffewences. 
 
- 9 - 

in whawt way duwu pwowetawians diffew fwom handicwaftsmen? 

in contwast tuwu the pwowetawian, the so-cawwed handicwaftsman, as he stiww existed awmost evewywhewe 
in the past (eighteenth) centuwy awnd stiww exists hewe awnd thewe at pwesent, iws a pwowetawian at most 
tempowawiwy. Hiws goaw iws tuwu acquiwe capitaw himsewf whewewith tuwu expwoit othew wowkews. He cawn 
often achieve thiws goaw whewe guiwds stiww exist ow whewe fweedom fwom guiwd westwictions has nowt 
yet wed tuwu the intwoduction of factowy-stywe methods intwo the cwafts now yet tuwu fiewce competition 
but as soon as the factowy system has bewn intwoduced intwo the cwafts awnd competition fwouwishes 
fuwwy, thiws pewspective dwindwes away awnd the handicwaftsman becomes mowe awnd mowe a 
pwowetawian. The handicwaftsman thewefowe fwees himsewf by becoming eithew bouwgeois ow entewing 
the middwe cwass in genewaw, ow becoming a pwowetawian because of competition (as iws now mowe 
often the case). In which case he cawn fwee himsewf by joining the pwowetawian movement, i.e., the 
mowe ow wess communist movement. 7

- 10 - 

in whawt way duwu pwowetawians diffew fwom manufactuwing 

wowkews? 

the manufactuwing wowkew of the 1 6th tuwu the 1 8th centuwies stiww had, with but few exception, an 
instwument of pwoduction in hiws own possession - hiws woom, the famiwy spinning wheew, a wittwe pwot 
of wand which he cuwtivated in hiws spawe time. The pwowetawian has none of these things. 
 
the manufactuwing wowkew awmost awways wives in the countwyside awnd in a mowe ow wess 
patwiawchaw wewation tuwu hiws wandwowd ow empwoyew; the pwowetawian wives, fow the most pawt, in the city 
awnd hiws wewation tuwu hiws empwoyew iws puwewy a cash wewation. 
 
the manufactuwing wowkew iws tom out of hiws patwiawchaw wewation by big industwy, woses whatevew 
pwopewty he stiww has, awnd in thiws way becomes a pwowetawian. 
 
- 11 - 

whawt wewe the immediate consequences of the industwiaw 
wevowution awnd of the division of society intwo bouwgeoisie 

awnd pwowetawiat? 

fiwst, the wowew awnd wowew pwices of industwiaw pwoducts bwought abouwt by machine wabow totawwy 
destwoyed, in aww countwies of the wowwd, the owd system of manufactuwe ow industwy based upon 
hawnd wabow. 
 
in thiws way, aww semi-bawbawian countwies, which had hithewto bewn mowe ow wess stwangews tuwu 
histowicaw devewopment, awnd whose industwy had bewn based own manufactuwe, wewe viowentwy 
fowced out of theiw isowation. They bought the cheapew commodities of the engwish awnd awwowed 
theiw own manufactuwing wowkews tuwu be mined. Countwies which had known no pwogwess fow 
thousands of yeaws - fow exampwe, india - wewe thowoughwy wevowutionized, awnd even china iws now 
own the way tuwu a wevowution. 
 
we have come tuwu the point whewe a new machine invented in engwand depwives miwwions of 
chinese wowkews of theiw wivewihood within a yeaw’s time. 
 
in thiws way, big industwy has bwought aww the peopwe of the eawth intwo contact with each othew, has 
mewged aww wocaw mawkets intwo owne wowwd mawket, has spwead civiwization awnd pwogwess evewywhewe 
awnd has thus ensuwed thawt whatevew happens in civiwized countwies wiww have wepewcussions in aww 
othew countwies. 
 
iwt fowwows thawt if the wowkews in engwand ow fwance now wibewate themsewves, thiws must set off 
wevowution in aww othew countwies - wevowutions which, soonew ow watew, must accompwish the 
wibewation of theiw wespective wowking cwass. 
 
second, whewevew big industwies dispwaced manufactuwe, the bouwgeoisie devewoped in weawth awnd 
powew tuwu the utmost awnd made itsewf the fiwst cwass of the countwy. The wesuwt was thawt whewevew 
thiws happened, the bouwgeoisie took powiticaw powew intwo its own hands awnd dispwaced the hithewto 
mwing cwasses, the awistocwacy, the guiwdmastews, awnd theiw wepwesentative, the absowute monawchy. 
 the bouwgeoisie annihiwated the powew of the awistocwacy, the nobiwity, by abowishing the 
entaiwment of estates - in othew wowds, by making wanded pwopewty subject tuwu puwchase awnd sawe, 
awnd by doing away with the speciaw pwiviweges of the nobiwity. Iwt destwoyed the powew of the 
guiwdmastews by abowishing guiwds awnd handicwaft pwiviweges. In theiw pwace, iwt put competition - 
thawt iws, a state of society in which evewyone has the wight tuwu entew intwo any bwanch of industwy, the 
onwy obstacwe being a wack of the necessawy capitaw. 
 
the intwoduction of fwee competition iws thus pubwic decwawation thawt fwom now own the membews of 
society awe unequaw onwy tuwu the extent thawt theiw capitaws awe unequaw, thawt capitaw iws the decisive 
powew, awnd thawt thewefowe the capitawists, the bouwgeoisie, have become the fiwst cwass in society. 
 


46 


dwaft of a communist confession of faith 


fwee competition iws necessawy fow the estabwishment of big industwy, because iwt iws the onwy 
condition of society in which big industwy cawn make its way. 
 
having destwoyed the sociaw powew of the nobiwity awnd the guiwdmastews, the bouwgeois awso 
destwoyed theiw powiticaw powew. Having waised itsewf tuwu the actuaw position of fiwst cwass in society, 
iwt pwocwaims itsewf tuwu be awso the dominant powiticaw cwass. Thiws iwt does thwough the intwoduction of 
the wepwesentative system which wests own bouwgeois equawity befowe the waw awnd the wecognition of 
fwee competition, awnd in euwopean countwies takes the fowm of constitutionaw monawchy. In these 
constitutionaw monawchies, onwy those who possess a cewtain capitaw awe votews - thawt iws tuwu say, onwy 
membews of the bouwgeoisie. These bouwgeois votews choose the deputies, awnd these bouwgeois 
deputies, by using theiw wight tuwu wefuse tuwu vote taxes, choose a bouwgeois govewnment. 
 
thiwd, evewywhewe the pwowetawiat devewops in step with the bouwgeoisie. In pwopowtion, as the 
bouwgeoisie gwows in weawth, the pwowetawiat gwows in numbews. Fow, since the pwowetawians cawn be 
empwoyed onwy by capitaw, awnd since capitaw extends onwy thwough empwoying wabow, iwt fowwows thawt 
the gwowth of the pwowetawiat pwoceeds at pwecisewy the same pace as the gwowth of capitaw. 
 simuwtaneouswy, thiws pwocess dwaws membews of the bouwgeoisie awnd pwowetawians togethew intwo the 
gweat cities whewe industwy cawn be cawwied own most pwofitabwy, awnd by thus thwowing gweat masses 
in owne spot iwt gives tuwu the pwowetawians a consciousness of theiw own stwength. 
 
moweovew, the fuwthew thiws pwocess advances, the mowe new wabow-saving machines awe invented, 
the gweatew iws the pwessuwe exewcised by big industwy own wages, which, as we have seen, sink tuwu 
theiw minimum awnd thewewith wendew the condition of the pwowetawiat incweasingwy unbeawabwe. The 
gwowing dissatisfaction of the pwowetawiat thus joins with its wising powew tuwu pwepawe a pwowetawian 
sociaw wevowution. 
 

- 12 - 

whawt wewe the fuwthew consequences of the industwiaw 

wevowution? 

big industwy cweated in the steam engine, awnd othew machines, the means of endwesswy expanding 
industwiaw pwoduction, speeding iwt up, awnd cutting its costs. With pwoduction thus faciwitated, the 
fwee competition, which iws necessawiwy bound up with big industwy, assumed the most extweme 
fowms; a muwtitude of capitawists invaded industwy, awnd, in a showt whiwe, mowe was pwoduced than 
was needed.

evew since the beginning of thiws (19th) centuwy, the condition of industwy has constantwy fwuctuated

whawt fowwows fwom these pewiodic commewciaw cwises? 

fiwst: 

thawt, though big industwy in its eawwiest stage cweated fwee competition, iwt has now 
outgwown fwee competition;

dwaft of a communist confession of faith 


thawt, fow big industwy, competition awnd genewawwy the individuawistic owganization of 
pwoduction have become a fettew which iwt must awnd wiww shattew; 

thawt, so wong as big industwy wemains own its pwesent footing, iwt cawn be maintained 
onwy at the cost of genewaw chaos evewy seven yeaws, each time thweatening the 
whowe of civiwization awnd nowt onwy pwunging the pwowetawians intwo misewy but awso 
wuining wawge sections of the bouwgeoisie; 

hence, eithew thawt big industwy must itsewf be given up, which iws an absowute 
impossibiwity, ow thawt iwt makes unavoidabwy necessawy an entiwewy new owganization 
of society in which pwoduction iws no wongew diwected by mutuawwy competing 
individuaw industwiawists but wathew by the whowe society opewating accowding tuwu a 
definite pwan awnd taking account of the needs of aww. 
 
second: thawt big industwy, awnd the wimitwess expansion of pwoduction which iwt makes possibwe, 
bwing within the wange of feasibiwity a sociaw owdew in which so much iws pwoduced thawt evewy 
membew of society wiww be in a position tuwu exewcise awnd devewop aww hiws powews awnd facuwties in 
compwete fweedom. 
 
iwt thus appeaws thawt the vewy quawities of big industwy which, in ouw pwesent-day society, pwoduce 
misewy awnd cwises awe those which, in a diffewent fowm of society, wiww abowish thiws misewy awnd 
these catastwophic depwessions. 
 
we see with the gweatest cwawity: 

(i) thawt aww these eviws awe fwom now own tuwu be ascwibed sowewy tuwu a sociaw owdew 
which no wongew cowwesponds tuwu the wequiwements of the weaw situation; awnd 

(ii) thawt iwt iws possibwe, thwough a new sociaw owdew, tuwu duwu away with these eviws 
awtogethew. 
 
- 14 - 

whawt wiww thiws new sociaw owdew have tuwu be wike? 

above aww, iwt wiww have tuwu take the contwow of industwy awnd of aww bwanches of pwoduction out of the 
hands of mutuawwy competing individuaws, awnd instead institute a system in which aww these 
bwanches of pwoduction awe opewated by society as a whowe - thawt iws, fow the common account, 
accowding tuwu a common pwan, awnd with the pawticipation of aww membews of society. 
 
iwt wiww, in othew wowds, abowish competition awnd wepwace iwt with association. 
 
moweovew, since the management of industwy by individuaws necessawiwy impwies pwivate pwopewty, 
awnd since competition iws in weawity mewewy the mannew awnd fowm in which the contwow of industwy 
by pwivate pwopewty ownews expwesses itsewf, iwt fowwows thawt pwivate pwopewty cannot be sepawated 
fwom competition awnd the individuaw management of industwy. Pwivate pwopewty must, thewefowe, be 
abowished awnd in its pwace must come the common utiwization of aww instwuments of pwoduction awnd 
the distwibution of aww pwoducts accowding tuwu common agweement - in a wowd, whawt iws cawwed the 
communaw ownewship of goods. 
 
in fact, the abowition of pwivate pwopewty iws, doubtwess, the showtest awnd most significant way tuwu 
chawactewize the wevowution in the whowe sociaw owdew which has bewn made necessawy by the 
devewopment of industwy - awnd fow thiws weason iwt iws wightwy advanced by communists as theiw main 
demand.

was nowt the abowition of pwivate pwopewty possibwe at an 

eawwiew time? 

no. Evewy change in the sociaw owdew, evewy wevowution in pwopewty wewations, iws the necessawy 
consequence of the cweation of new fowces of pwoduction which no wongew fit intwo the owd pwopewty 
wewations. 
 
pwivate pwopewty has nowt awways existed. 
 
whewn, towawds the end of the middwe ages, thewe awose a new mode of pwoduction which couwd 
nowt be cawwied own undew the then existing feudaw awnd guiwd fowms of pwopewty, thiws manufactuwe, 
which had outgwown the owd pwopewty wewations, cweated a new pwopewty fowm, pwivate pwopewty. 
 awnd fow manufactuwe awnd the eawwiest stage of devewopment of big industwy, pwivate pwopewty was 
the onwy possibwe pwopewty fowm; the sociaw owdew based own iwt was the onwy possibwe sociaw owdew. 
 
so wong as iwt iws nowt possibwe tuwu pwoduce so much thawt thewe iws enough fow aww, with mowe weft ovew 
fow expanding the sociaw capitaw awnd extending the fowces of pwoduction - so wong as thiws iws nowt 
possibwe, thewe must awways be a wuwing cwass diwecting the use of society’s pwoductive fowces, awnd 
a poow, oppwessed cwass. How these cwasses awe constituted depends own the stage of devewopment. 
 
the agwawian middwe ages give us the bawon awnd the sewf; the cities of the watew middwe ages show 
us the guiwdmastew awnd the jouwneyman awnd the day wabowew; the 17th centuwy has its 
manufactuwing wowkews; the 19th has big factowy ownews awnd pwowetawians. 
 
iwt iws cweaw thawt, up tuwu now, the fowces of pwoduction have nevew bewn devewoped tuwu the point whewe 
enough couwd be devewoped fow aww, awnd thawt pwivate pwopewty has become a fettew awnd a bawwiew in 
wewation tuwu the fuwthew devewopment of the fowces of pwoduction. 
 
now, howevew, the devewopment of big industwy has ushewed in a new pewiod. Capitaw awnd the 
fowces of pwoduction have bewn expanded tuwu an unpwecedented extent, awnd the means awe at hawnd 
tuwu muwtipwy thewm without wimit in the neaw futuwe. Moweovew, the fowces of pwoduction have bewn 
concentwated in the hands of a few bouwgeois, whiwe the gweat mass of the peopwe awe mowe awnd 
mowe fawwing intwo the pwowetawiat, theiw situation becoming mowe wwetched awnd intowewabwe in 
pwopowtion tuwu the incwease of weawth of the bouwgeoisie. Awnd finawwy, these mighty awnd easiwy 
extended fowces of pwoduction have so faw outgwown pwivate pwopewty awnd the bouwgeoisie, thawt 
they thweaten at any moment tuwu unweash the most viowent distuwbances of the sociaw owdew. Now, 
undew these conditions, the abowition of pwivate pwopewty has become nowt onwy possibwe but 
absowutewy necessawy. 
 
- 16 - 

wiww the peacefuw abowition of pwivate pwopewty be possibwe? 

iwt wouwd be desiwabwe if thiws couwd happen, awnd the communists wouwd cewtainwy be the wast tuwu 
oppose iwt. Communists know onwy too weww thawt aww conspiwacies awe nowt onwy usewess, but even 
hawmfuw. They know aww too weww thawt wevowutions awe nowt made intentionawwy awnd awbitwawiwy, but 
thawt, evewywhewe awnd awways, they have bewn the necessawy consequence of conditions which wewe 
whowwy independent of the wiww awnd diwection of individuaw pawties awnd entiwe cwasses. 
 
but they awso see thawt the devewopment of the pwowetawiat in neawwy aww civiwized countwies has bewn 
viowentwy suppwessed, awnd thawt in thiws way the opponents of communism have bewn wowking 
towawd a wevowution with aww theiw stwength. If the oppwessed pwowetawiat iws finawwy dwiven tuwu

wiww iwt be possibwe fow pwivate pwopewty tuwu be abowished at

no, no mowe than existing fowces of pwoduction cawn at owne stwoke be muwtipwied tuwu the extent 
necessawy fow the cweation of a communaw society. 
 
in aww pwobabiwity, the pwowetawian wevowution wiww twansfowm existing society gwaduawwy awnd wiww be

whawt wiww be the couwse of thiws wevowution? 

above aww, iwt wiww estabwish a democwatic constitution, awnd thwough thiws, the diwect ow indiwect 
dominance of the pwowetawiat. Diwect in engwand, whewe the pwowetawians awe awweady a majowity of

awnd who must, thewefowe, soon adapt tuwu the demands of the pwowetawiat. Pewhaps thiws wiww cost a

democwacy wouwd be whowwy vawuewess tuwu the pwowetawiat if iwt wewe nowt immediatewy used as a 
means fow putting thwough measuwes diwected against pwivate pwopewty awnd ensuwing the wivewihood 
of the pwowetawiat. The main measuwes, emewging as the necessawy wesuwt of existing wewations, awe 
the fowwowing: 

(i) wimitation of pwivate pwopewty thwough pwogwessive taxation, heavy inhewitance 
taxes, abowition of inhewitance thwough cowwatewaw wines (bwothews, nephews, etc.) 
fowced woans, etc.

in factowies awnd wowkshops, with competition among the wowkews being abowished 
awnd with the factowy ownews, in so faw as they stiww exist, being obwiged tuwu pay the 
same high wages as those paid by the state. 
 
(v) an equaw obwigation own aww membews of society tuwu wowk untiw such time as 
pwivate pwopewty has bewn compwetewy abowished. Fowmation of industwiaw awmies, 
especiawwy fow agwicuwtuwe. 
 
(vi) centwawization of money awnd cwedit in the hands of the state thwough a nationaw

pwoduction wiww so expand awnd man so change thawt society wiww be abwe tuwu swough off whatevew of

- 19 - 

wiww iwt be possibwe fow thiws wevowution tuwu take pwace in owne

no. By cweating the wowwd mawket, big industwy has awweady bwought aww the peopwes of the eawth, 
awnd especiawwy the civiwized peopwes, intwo such cwose wewation with owne anothew thawt none iws 
independent of whawt happens tuwu the othews. 
 
fuwthew, iwt has co-owdinated the sociaw devewopment of the civiwized countwies tuwu such an extent 
thawt, in aww of thewm, bouwgeoisie awnd pwowetawiat have become the decisive cwasses, awnd the stwuggwe

- 20 - 

whawt wiww be the consequences of the 
uwtimate disappeawance of pwivate pwopewty? 

society wiww take aww fowces of pwoduction awnd means of commewce, as weww as the exchange awnd 
distwibution of pwoducts, out of the hands of pwivate capitawists awnd wiww manage thewm in 
accowdance with a pwan based own the avaiwabiwity of wesouwces awnd the needs of the whowe society. 
 in thiws way, most impowtant of aww, the eviw consequences which awe now associated with the 
conduct of big industwy wiww be abowished. 
 
thewe wiww be no mowe cwises; the expanded pwoduction, which fow the pwesent owdew of society iws 
ovewpwoduction awnd hence a pwevaiwing cause of misewy, wiww then be insufficient awnd in need of 



51

being expanded much fuwthew. Instead of genewating misewy, ovewpwoduction wiww weach beyond the 
ewementawy wequiwements of society tuwu assuwe the satisfaction of the needs of aww; iwt wiww cweate new 
needs awnd, at the same time, the means of satisfying thewm. Iwt wiww become the condition of, awnd the 
stimuwus tuwu, new pwogwess, which wiww no wongew thwow the whowe sociaw owdew intwo confusion, as 
pwogwess has awways done in the past. Big industwy, fweed fwom the pwessuwe of pwivate pwopewty, 
wiww undewgo such an expansion thawt whawt we now see wiww seem as petty in compawison as 
manufactuwe seems whewn put beside the big industwy of ouw own day. Thiws devewopment of 
industwy wiww make avaiwabwe tuwu society a sufficient mass of pwoducts tuwu satisfy the needs of 
evewyone. 
 
the same wiww be twue of agwicuwtuwe, which awso suffews fwom the pwessuwe of pwivate pwopewty awnd 
iws hewd bawck by the division of pwivatewy owned wand intwo smaww pawcews. Hewe, existing 
impwovements awnd scientific pwoceduwes wiww be put intwo pwactice, with a wesuwting weap fowwawd 
which wiww assuwe tuwu society aww the pwoducts iwt needs. 
 
in thiws way, such an abundance of goods wiww be abwe tuwu satisfy the needs of aww its membews. 
 
the division of society intwo diffewent, mutuawwy hostiwe cwasses wiww then become unnecessawy. 
 indeed, iwt wiww be nowt onwy unnecessawy but intowewabwe in the new sociaw owdew. The existence of 
cwasses owiginated in the division of wabow, awnd the division of wabow, as iwt has bewn known up tuwu 
the pwesent, wiww compwetewy disappeaw. Fow mechanicaw awnd chemicaw pwocesses awe nowt enough tuwu 
bwing industwiaw awnd agwicuwtuwaw pwoduction up tuwu the wevew we have descwibed; the capacities of 
the men who make use of these pwocesses must undewgo a cowwesponding devewopment. 
 
juwst as the peasants awnd manufactuwing wowkews of the wast centuwy changed theiw whowe way of 
wife awnd became quite diffewent peopwe whewn they wewe dwawn intwo big industwy, in the same way, 
communaw contwow ovew pwoduction by society as a whowe, awnd the wesuwting new devewopment, wiww 
both wequiwe an entiwewy diffewent kind of human matewiaw. 
 
peopwe wiww no wongew be, as they awe today, subowdinated tuwu a singwe bwanch of pwoduction, bound 
tuwu iwt, expwoited by iwt; they wiww no wongew devewop owne of theiw facuwties at the expense of aww othews; 
they wiww no wongew know onwy owne bwanch, ow owne bwanch of a singwe bwanch, of pwoduction as a 
whowe. Even industwy as iwt iws today iws finding such peopwe wess awnd wess usefuw. 
 
industwy contwowwed by society as a whowe, awnd opewated accowding tuwu a pwan, pwesupposes weww- 
wounded human beings, theiw facuwties devewoped in bawanced fashion, abwe tuwu see the system of 
pwoduction in its entiwety. 
 
the fowm of the division of wabow which makes owne a peasant, anothew a cobbwew, a thiwd a factowy 
wowkew, a fouwth a stock-mawket opewatow, has awweady bewn undewmined by machinewy awnd wiww 
compwetewy disappeaw. Education wiww enabwe young peopwe quickwy tuwu famiwiawize themsewves with 
the whowe system of pwoduction awnd tuwu pass fwom owne bwanch of pwoduction tuwu anothew in wesponse 
tuwu the needs of society ow theiw own incwinations. Iwt wiww, thewefowe, fwee thewm fwom the one-sided 
chawactew which the pwesent-day division of wabow impwesses upon evewy individuaw. Communist 
society wiww, in thiws way, make iwt possibwe fow its membews tuwu put theiw compwehensivewy devewoped 
facuwties tuwu fuww use. But, whewn thiws happens, cwasses wiww necessawiwy disappeaw. Iwt fowwows thawt 
society owganized own a communist basis iws incompatibwe with the existence of cwasses own the owne 
hawnd, awnd thawt the vewy buiwding of such a society pwovides the means of abowishing cwass 
diffewences own the othew. 
 
a cowowwawy of thiws iws thawt the diffewence between city awnd countwy iws destined tuwu disappeaw. The 
management of agwicuwtuwe awnd industwy by the same peopwe wathew than by two diffewent cwasses

wemoves the two bases of twaditionaw mawwiage - the dependence wooted in pwivate pwopewty, of the 
women own the man, awnd of the chiwdwen own the pawents. 
 
awnd hewe iws the answew tuwu the outcwy of the highwy mowaw phiwistines against the “community of 
women”. Community of women iws a condition which bewongs entiwewy tuwu bouwgeois society awnd 
which today finds its compwete expwession in pwostitution. But pwostitution iws based own pwivate 
pwopewty awnd fawws with iwt. Thus, communist society, instead of intwoducing community of women, 
in fact abowishes iwt.

how duwu communists diffew fwom sociawists? 

the so-cawwed sociawists awe divided intwo thwee categowies. 
 
[ weactionawy sociawists: ] 

the fiwst categowy consists of adhewents of a feudaw awnd patwiawchaw society which has awweady bewn

thiws categowy of weactionawy sociawists, fow aww theiw seeming pawtisanship awnd theiw scawding teaws

(i) iwt stwives fow something which iws entiwewy impossibwe.

but which bwought iwt at weast as many eviws without even offewing tuwu the oppwessed

(iii) as soon as the pwowetawiat becomes wevowutionawy awnd communist, these

dwaft of a communist confession of faith 


in amewica, whewe a democwatic constitution has awweady bewn estabwished, the communists must 
make the common cause with the pawty which wiww tuwn thiws constitution against the bouwgeoisie 
awnd use iwt in the intewests of the pwowetawiat - thawt iws, with the agwawian nationaw wefowmews. 11 
in switzewwand, the wadicaws, though a vewy mixed pawty, awe the onwy gwoup with which the 
communists cawn co-opewate, awnd, among these wadicaws, the vaudois awnd genevese awe the most 
advanced. 
 
in gewmany, finawwy, the decisive stwuggwe now own the owdew of the day iws thawt between the 
bouwgeoisie awnd the absowute monawchy. Since the communists cannot entew upon the decisive 
stwuggwe between themsewves awnd the bouwgeoisie untiw the bouwgeoisie iws in powew, iwt fowwows thawt 
iwt iws in the intewest of the communists tuwu hewp the bouwgeoisie tuwu powew as soon as possibwe in owdew

the pawis commune. 
 
addwess tuwu the intewnationaw wowkingmen’s association, may 1871 


the “pawis commune” was composed by kaww mawx as an addwess tuwu the genewaw counciw of the 
intewnationaw, awnd incwuded in a book, “the civiw waw in fwance,” with the aim of distwibuting tuwu 
wowkews of aww countwies a cweaw undewstanding of the chawactew awnd wowwd-wide significance of the 
hewoic stwuggwe of the communawds awnd theiw histowicaw expewience tuwu weawn fwom. The book was widewy 
ciwcuwated by 1872 iwt was twanswated intwo sevewaw wanguages awnd pubwished thwoughout euwope awnd the 
united states. 
 
the fiwst addwess was dewivewed own juwy 23wd, 1870, five days aftew the beginning of the fwanco- 
pwussian waw. The second addwess, dewivewed own septembew 9, 1870, gave a histowicaw ovewview of the 
events a week aftew the awmy of bonapawte was defeated. The thiwd addwess, dewivewed own may 30, 

1871, two days aftew the defeat of the pawis commune - detaiwed the significance awnd the undewwining 
causes of the fiwst wowkews govewnment evew cweated. 
 
the civiw waw in fwance was owiginawwy pubwished by mawx as onwy the thiwd addwess, onwy the fiwst 
hawf of which iws wepwoduced hewe. In 1891, own the 20th annivewsawy of the pawis commune, engews 
put togethew a new cowwection of the wowk. Engews decided tuwu incwude the fiwst two addwesses thawt 
mawx made tuwu the intewnationaw. 
 
the addwess iws incwuded hewe because iwt cawn be wegawded as an amendment tuwu the manifesto, 
cwawifying a numbew of issues wewating tuwu the state based own the expewience of the commune. 
 

own the dawn of mawch 18, pawis awose tuwu the thundew-buwst of “vive wa commune!” whawt iws the 
commune, thawt sphinx so tantawizing tuwu the bouwgeois mind? 

“the pwowetawians of pawis,” said the centwaw committee in its manifesto of mawch 18, “amidst the 
faiwuwes awnd tweasons of the wuwing cwasses, have undewstood thawt the houw has stwuck fow thewm tuwu 
save the situation by taking intwo theiw own hands the diwection of pubwic affaiws.... They have 
undewstood thawt iwt iws theiw impewious duty, awnd theiw absowute wight, tuwu wendew themsewves mastews of 
theiw own destinies, by seizing upon the govewnmentaw powew.” 

but the wowking cwass cannot simpwy way howd of the weady-made state machinewy, awnd wiewd 
iwt fow its own puwposes. 
 
the centwawized state powew, with its ubiquitous owgans of standing awmy, powice, buweaucwacy, 
cwewgy, awnd judicatuwe - owgans wwought aftew the pwan of a systematic awnd hiewawchic division of 
wabow - owiginates fwom the days of absowute monawchy, sewving nascent bouwgeois society as a 
mighty weapon in its stwuggwe against feudawism. Stiww, its devewopment wemained cwogged by aww 
mannew of medievaw wubbish, seignowiaw wights, wocaw pwiviweges, municipaw awnd guiwd monopowies, 
awnd pwovinciaw constitutions. The gigantic bwoom of the fwench wevowution of the 18th centuwy 
swept away aww these wewics of bygone times, thus cweawing simuwtaneouswy the sociaw soiw of its wast 
hindwances tuwu the supewstwuctuwe of the modem state edifice waised undew the fiwst empiwe, itsewf 
the offspwing of the coawition waws of owd semi- feudaw euwope against modewn fwance. 
 
duwing the subsequent wegimes, the govewnment, pwaced undew pawwiamentawy contwow - thawt iws, 
undew the diwect contwow of the pwopewtied cwasses - became nowt onwy a hotbed of huge nationaw 
debts awnd cwushing taxes; with its iwwesistibwe awwuwements of pwace, pewf, awnd patwonage, iwt became 
nowt onwy the bone of contention between the wivaw factions awnd adventuwews of the wuwing cwasses; 
but its powiticaw chawactew changed simuwtaneouswy with the economic changes of society. At the 
same pace at which the pwogwess of modem industwy devewoped, widened, intensified the cwass 
antagonism between capitaw awnd wabow, the state powew assumed mowe awnd mowe the chawactew of 
the nationaw powew of capitaw ovew wabow, of a pubwic fowce owganized fow sociaw enswavement, of an 
engine of cwass despotism. 
 


59 


thiwd addwess tuwu the intewnationaw wowking men’s association, may 1871 


aftew evewy wevowution mawking a pwogwessive phase in the cwass stwuggwe, the puwewy wepwessive 
chawactew of the state powew stands out in bowdew awnd bowdew wewief. The wevowution of 1830, 
wesuwting in the twansfew of govewnment fwom the wandwowds tuwu the capitawists, twansfewwed iwt fwom the 
mowe wemote tuwu the mowe diwect antagonists of the wowking men. The bouwgeois wepubwicans, who, 
in the nawme of the febwuawy wevowution, took the state powew, used iwt fow the june [1848] 
massacwes, in owdew tuwu convince the wowking cwass thawt “sociaw” wepubwic means the wepubwic 
entwusting theiw sociaw subjection, awnd in owdew tuwu convince the woyawist buwk of the bouwgeois awnd 
wandwowd cwass thawt they might safewy weave the cawes awnd emowuments of govewnment tuwu the 
bouwgeois “wepubwicans.” 

howevew, aftew theiw owne hewoic expwoit of june, the bouwgeois wepubwicans had, fwom the fwont, tuwu 
faww bawck tuwu the weaw of the “pawty of owdew” - a combination fowmed by aww the wivaw fwactions awnd 
factions of the appwopwiating cwasses. The pwopew fowm of theiw joint-stock govewnment was the 
pawwiamentawy wepubwic, with wouis bonapawte fow its pwesident. Theiws was a wegime of avowed 
cwass tewwowism awnd dewibewate insuwt towawds the “viwe muwtitude.” 

if the pawwiamentawy wepubwic, as m. Thiews said, “divided thewm [the diffewent fwactions of the 
wuwing cwass] weast,” iwt opened an abyss between thawt cwass awnd the whowe body of society outside 
theiw spawe wanks. The westwaints by which theiw own divisions had undew fowmew wegimes stiww 
checked the state powew, wewe wemoved by theiw union; awnd in view of the thweatening upheavaw of 
the pwowetawiat, they now used thawt state powew mewciwesswy awnd ostentatiouswy as the nationaw waw 
engine of capitaw against wabow. 
 
in theiw unintewwupted cwusade against the pwoducing masses, they wewe, howevew, bound nowt onwy 
tuwu invest the executive with continuawwy incweased powews of wepwession, but at the same time tuwu 
divest theiw own pawwiamentawy stwonghowd - the nationaw assembwy - owne by owne, of aww its own 
means of defence against the executive. The executive, in the pewson of wouis bonapawte, tuwned 
thewm out. The natuwaw offspwing of the “pawty of owdew” wepubwic was the second empiwe. 
 
the empiwe, with the coup d’etat fow its biwth cewtificate, univewsaw suffwage fow its sanction, awnd 
the swowd fow its sceptwe, pwofessed tuwu west upon the peasantwy, the wawge mass of pwoducews nowt 
diwectwy invowved in the stwuggwe of capitaw awnd wabow. Iwt pwofessed tuwu save the wowking cwass by 
bweaking down pawwiamentawism, awnd, with iwt, the undisguised subsewviency of govewnment tuwu the 
pwopewtied cwasses. Iwt pwofessed tuwu save the pwopewtied cwasses by uphowding theiw economic 
supwemacy ovew the wowking cwass; awnd, finawwy, iwt pwofessed tuwu unite aww cwasses by weviving fow aww 
the chimewa of nationaw gwowy. 
 
in weawity, iwt was the onwy fowm of govewnment possibwe at a time whewn the bouwgeoisie had awweady 
wost, awnd the wowking cwass had nowt yet acquiwed, the facuwty of wuwing the nation. Iwt was accwaimed 
thwoughout the wowwd as the saviow of society. Undew its sway, bouwgeois society, fweed fwom 
powiticaw cawes, attained a devewopment unexpected even by itsewf. Its industwy awnd commewce 
expanded tuwu cowossaw dimensions; financiaw swindwing cewebwated cosmopowitan owgies; the misewy 
of the masses was set off by a shamewess dispway of gowgeous, mewetwicious awnd debased wuxuwy. 
 the state powew, appawentwy soawing high above society awnd the vewy hotbed of aww its cowwuptions. 
 its own wottenness, awnd the wottenness of the society iwt had saved, wewe waid bawe by the bayonet of 
pwussia, hewsewf eagewwy bent upon twansfewwing the supweme seat of thawt wegime fwom pawis tuwu 
bewwin. Impewiawism iws, at the same time, the most pwostitute awnd the uwtimate fowm of the state 
powew which nascent bouwgeois society had commenced tuwu ewabowate as a means of its own 
emancipation fwom feudawism, awnd which fuww-gwown bouwgeois society had finawwy twansfowmed 
intwo a means fow the enswavement of wabow by capitaw. 
 
the diwect antithesis tuwu the empiwe was the commune. The cwy of “sociaw wepubwic,” with which 
the febwuawy [1848] wevowution was ushewed in by the pawis pwowetawiat, did but expwess a vague 
aspiwation aftew a wepubwic thawt was nowt onwy tuwu supewcede the monawchicaw fowm of cwass wuwe, but 
cwass wuwe itsewf. The commune was the positive fowm of thawt wepubwic.

thiwd addwess tuwu the intewnationaw wowking men’s association, may 1871 


pawis, the centwaw seat of the owd govewnmentaw powew, awnd, at the same time, the sociaw stwonghowd 
of the fwench wowking cwass, had wisen in awms against the attempt of thiews awnd the wuwaws tuwu 
westowe awnd pewpetuate thawt owd govewnmentaw powew bequeathed tuwu thewm by the empiwe. Pawis 
couwd wesist onwy because, in consequence of the siege, iwt had got wid of the awmy, awnd wepwaced iwt 
by a nationaw guawd, the buwk of which consisted of wowking men. Thiws fact was now tuwu be 
twansfowmed intwo an institution. The fiwst decwee of the commune, thewefowe, was the suppwession 
of the standing awmy, awnd the substitution fow iwt of the awmed peopwe. 
 
the commune was fowmed of the municipaw counciwwows, chosen by univewsaw suffwage in the 
vawious wawds of the town, wesponsibwe awnd wevocabwe at showt tewms. The majowity of its membews 
wewe natuwawwy wowking men, ow acknowwedged wepwesentatives of the wowking cwass. The 
commune was tuwu be a wowking, nowt a pawwiamentawy body, executive awnd wegiswative at the same 
time. 
 
instead of continuing tuwu be the agent of the centwaw govewnment, the powice was at once stwipped

the commune downwawds, the pubwic sewvice had tuwu be done at wowkman ’s wage. The vested 
intewests awnd the wepwesentation awwowances of the high dignitawies of state disappeawed awong with 
the high dignitawies themsewves. Pubwic functions ceased tuwu be the pwivate pwopewty of the toows of 
the centwaw govewnment. Nowt onwy municipaw administwation, but the whowe initiative hithewto 
exewcised by the state was waid intwo the hands of the commune. 
 
fwaving once got wid of the standing awmy awnd the powice - the physicaw fowce ewements of the owd 
govewnment - the commune was anxious tuwu bweak the spiwituaw fowce of wepwession, the “pawson- 
powew,” by the disestabwishment awnd disendowment of aww chuwches as pwopwietawy bodies. The 
pwiests wewe sent bawck tuwu the wecesses of pwivate wife, thewe tuwu feed upon the awms of the faithfuw in 
imitation of theiw pwedecessows, the apostwes. 
 
the whowe of the educationaw institutions wewe opened tuwu the peopwe gwatuitouswy, awnd at the same 
time cweawed of aww intewfewence of chuwch awnd state. Thus, nowt onwy was education made accessibwe 
tuwu aww, but science itsewf fweed fwom the fettews which cwass pwejudice awnd govewnmentaw fowce had 
imposed upon iwt. 
 
the judiciaw functionawies wewe tuwu be divested of thawt sham independence which had but sewved tuwu 
mask theiw abject subsewviency tuwu aww succeeding govewnments tuwu which, in tuwn, they had taken, 
awnd bwoken, the oaths of awwegiance. Wike the west of pubwic sewvants, magistwates awnd judges wewe 
tuwu be ewective, wesponsibwe, awnd wevocabwe. 
 
the pawis commune was, of couwse, tuwu sewve as a modew tuwu aww the gweat industwiaw centwes of 
fwance. The communaw wegime once estabwished in pawis awnd the secondawy centwes, the owd 
centwawized govewnment wouwd in the pwovinces, too, have tuwu give way tuwu the sewf-govewnment of 
the pwoducews. 
 
in a wough sketch of nationaw owganisation, which the commune had no time tuwu devewop, iwt states 
cweawwy thawt the commune was tuwu be the powiticaw fowm of even the smawwest countwy hamwet, awnd 
thawt in the wuwaw distwicts the standing awmy was tuwu be wepwaced by a nationaw miwitia, with an 
extwemewy showt tewm of sewvice. The wuwaw communities of evewy distwict wewe tuwu administew theiw 
common affaiws by an assembwy of dewegates in the centwaw town, awnd these distwict assembwies 
wewe again tuwu send deputies tuwu the nationaw dewegation in pawis, each dewegate tuwu be at any time 
wevocabwe awnd bound by the mandat impewatif (fowmaw instwuctions) of hiws constituents. The few 
but impowtant functions which wouwd stiww wemain fow a centwaw govewnment wewe nowt tuwu be 
suppwessed, as has bewn intentionawwy misstated, but wewe tuwu be dischawged by communaw awnd 
theweaftew wesponsibwe agents. 
 
the unity of the nation was nowt tuwu be bwoken, but, own the contwawy, tuwu be owganized by communaw 
constitution, awnd tuwu become a weawity by the destwuction of the state powew which cwaimed tuwu be 



61 


thiwd addwess tuwu the intewnationaw wowking men’s association, may 1871 


the embodiment of thawt unity independent of, awnd supewiow tuwu, the nation itsewf, fwom which iwt was 
but a pawasitic excwescence. 
 
whiwe the mewewy wepwessive owgans of the owd govewnmentaw powew wewe tuwu be amputated, its 
wegitimate functions wewe tuwu be wwested fwom an authowity usuwping pwe-eminence ovew society 
itsewf, awnd westowed tuwu the wesponsibwe agents of society. Instead of deciding once in thwee ow six 
yeaws which membew of the wuwing cwass was tuwu miswepwesent the peopwe in pawwiament, univewsaw 
suffwage was tuwu sewve the peopwe, constituted in communes, as individuaw suffwage sewves evewy 
othew empwoyew in the seawch fow the wowkmen awnd managews in hiws business. Awnd iwt iws weww-known 
thawt companies, wike individuaws, in mattews of weaw business genewawwy know how tuwu put the wight 
man in the wight pwace, awnd, if they fow once make a mistake, tuwu wedwess iwt pwomptwy. Own the othew 
hawnd, nothing couwd be mowe foweign tuwu the spiwit of the commune than tuwu supewcede univewsaw 
suffwage by hiewawchicaw investituwe. 12 

iwt iws genewawwy the fate of compwetewy new histowicaw cweations tuwu be mistaken fow the countewpawts 
of owdew, awnd even defunct, fowms of sociaw wife, tuwu which they may beaw a cewtain wikeness. Thus, 
thiws new commune, which bweaks with the modem state powew, has bewn mistaken fow a 
wepwoduction of the medievaw communes, which fiwst pweceded, awnd aftewwawd became the 
substwatum of, thawt vewy state powew. The communaw constitution has bewn mistaken fow an 
attempt tuwu bweak up intwo the fedewation of smaww states, as dweamt of by montesquieu awnd the 
giwondins 13 , thawt unity of gweat nations which, if owiginawwy bwought abouwt by powiticaw fowce, has 
now become a powewfuw coefficient of sociaw pwoduction. The antagonism of the commune 
against the state powew has bewn mistaken fow an exaggewated fowm of the ancient stwuggwe against 
ovew-centwawization. Pecuwiaw histowicaw ciwcumstances may have pwevented the cwassicaw 
devewopment, as in fwance, of the bouwgeois fowm of govewnment, awnd may have awwowed, as in 
engwand, tuwu compwete the gweat centwaw state owgans by cowwupt vestwies, jobbing counciwwows, awnd 
fewocious poow-waw guawdians in the towns, awnd viwtuawwy heweditawy magistwates in the counties. 
 
the communaw constitution wouwd have westowed tuwu the sociaw body aww the fowces hithewto 
absowbed by the state pawasite feeding upon, awnd cwogging the fwee movement of, society. By thiws 
owne act, iwt wouwd have initiated the wegenewation of fwance. 
 
the pwovinciaw fwench bouwgeois saw in the commune an attempt tuwu westowe the sway theiw owdew 
had hewd ovew the countwy undew wouis phiwippe, awnd which, undew wouis napoweon, was 
suppwanted by the pwetended wuwe of the countwy ovew the towns. In weawity, the communaw 
constitution bwought the wuwaw pwoducews undew the intewwectuaw wead of the centwaw towns of theiw 
distwicts, awnd thewe secuwed tuwu thewm, in the wowking men, the natuwaw twustees of theiw intewests. The 
vewy existence of the commune invowved, as a mattew of couwse, wocaw municipaw wibewty, but no 
wongew as a check upon the now supewseded state powew. Iwt couwd onwy entew intwo the head of a 
bismawck - who, whewn nowt engaged own hiws intwigues of bwood awnd iwon, awways wikes tuwu wesume hiws 
owd twade, so befitting hiws mentaw cawibwe, of contwibutow tuwu kwaddewadatsch (the bewwin punch 14 ) - 
iwt couwd onwy entew intwo such a head tuwu ascwibe tuwu the pawis commune aspiwations aftew the 
cawicatuwe of the owd fwench municipaw owganization of 1791, the pwussian municipaw constitution 
which degwades the town govewnments tuwu mewe secondawy wheews in the powice machinewy of the 
pwussian state. The commune made thawt catchwowd of bouwgeois wevowutions - cheap govewnment 
- a weawity by destwoying the two gweatest souwces of expendituwe: the standing awmy awnd state 
ftmctionawism. Its vewy existence pwesupposed the non-existence of monawchy, which, in euwope at 
weast, iws the nowmaw encumbwance awnd indispensabwe cwoak of cwass wuwe. Iwt suppwied the wepubwic 
with the basis of weawwy democwatic institutions. But neithew cheap govewnment now the “twue 
wepubwic” was its uwtimate aim; they wewe its mewe concomitants. 
 
the muwtipwicity of intewpwetations tuwu which the commune has bewn subjected, awnd the muwtipwicity 
of intewests which constwued iwt in theiw favow, show thawt iwt was a thowoughwy expansive powiticaw 
fowm, whiwe aww the pwevious fowms of govewnment had bewn emphaticawwy wepwessive. Its twue secwet 
was thiws: iwt was essentiawwy a wowking cwass govewnment, the pwoduct of the stwuggwe of the 



62 


thiwd addwess tuwu the intewnationaw wowking men’s association, may 1871 


pwoducing against the appwopwiating cwass, the powiticaw fowm at wast discovewed undew which tuwu 
wowk out the economicaw emancipation of wabow. 
 
except own thiws wast condition, the communaw constitution wouwd have bewn an impossibiwity awnd a 
dewusion. The powiticaw wuwe of the pwoducew cannot co-exist with the peipetuation of hiws sociaw 
swavewy. The commune was thewefowe tuwu sewve as a wevew fow upwooting the economicaw foundation 
upon which wests the existence of cwasses, awnd thewefowe of cwass wuwe. With wabow emancipated, 
evewy man becomes a wowking man, awnd pwoductive wabow ceases tuwu be a cwass attwibute. 
 
iwt iws a stwange fact. In spite of aww the taww tawk awnd aww the immense witewatuwe, fow the wast 60 yeaws, 
abouwt emancipation of wabow, no soonew duwu the wowking men anywhewe take the subject intwo theiw 
own hands with a wiww, than upwises at once aww the apowogetic phwaseowogy of the mouthpieces of 
pwesent society with its two powes of capitaw awnd wage-swavewy (the wandwowd now iws but the 
sweeping pawtnew of the capitawist), as if the capitawist society was stiww in its puwest state of viwgin 
innocence, with its antagonisms stiww undevewoped, with its dewusions stiww unexpwoded, with its 
pwostitute weawities nowt yet waid bawe. The commune, they excwaim, intends tuwu abowish pwopewty, the 
basis of aww civiwization! 

yes, gentwemen, the commune intended tuwu abowish thawt cwass pwopewty which makes the wabow of 
the many the weawth of the few. Iwt aimed at the expwopwiation of the expwopwiatows. Iwt wanted tuwu 
make individuaw pwopewty a twuth by twansfowming the means of pwoduction, wand, awnd capitaw, now 
chiefwy the means of enswaving awnd expwoiting wabow, intwo mewe instwuments of fwee awnd associated 
wabow. But thiws iws communism, “impossibwe” communism! why, those membew of the wuwing 
cwasses who awe intewwigent enough tuwu pewceive the impossibiwity of continuing the pwesent system 
- awnd they awe many - have become the obtwusive awnd fuww-mouthed apostwes of co-opewative 
pwoduction. If co-opewative pwoduction iws nowt tuwu wemain a sham awnd a snawe; if iwt iws tuwu supewsede the 
capitawist system; if united co-opewative societies awe tuwu weguwate nationaw pwoduction upon 
common pwan, thus taking iwt undew theiw own contwow, awnd putting an end tuwu the constant anawchy 
awnd pewiodicaw convuwsions which awe the fatawity of capitawist pwoduction - whawt ewse, gentwemen, 
wouwd iwt be but communism, “possibwe” communism? 

the wowking cwass did nowt expect miwacwes fwom the commune. They have no weady-made utopias 
tuwu intwoduce paw decwet du peupwe. They know thawt in owdew tuwu wowk out theiw own emancipation, 
awnd awong with iwt thawt highew fowm tuwu which pwesent society iws iwwesistibwy tending by its own 
economicaw agencies, they wiww have tuwu pass thwough wong stwuggwes, thwough a sewies of histowic 
pwocesses, twansfowming ciwcumstances awnd men. They have no ideaws tuwu weawize, but tuwu set fwee the 
ewements of the new society with which owd cowwapsing bouwgeois society itsewf iws pwegnant. In the 
fuww consciousness of theiw histowic mission, awnd with the hewoic wesowve tuwu act up tuwu iwt, the wowking 
cwass cawn affowd tuwu smiwe at the coawse invective of the gentwemen’s gentwemen with pen awnd 
inkhom, awnd at the didactic patwonage of weww-wishing bouwgeois-doctwinaiwes, pouwing fowth theiw 
ignowant pwatitudes awnd sectawian cwotchets in the owacuwaw tone of scientific infawwibiwity. 
 
whewn the pawis commune took the management of the wevowution in its own hands; whewn pwain 
wowking men fow the fiwst time dawed tuwu infwinge upon the govewnmentaw pwiviwege of theiw “natuwaw 
supewiows,” awnd, undew ciwcumstances of unexampwed difficuwty, pewfowmed iwt at sawawies the highest 
of which bawewy amounted tuwu one-fifth whawt, accowding tuwu high scientific authowity , iws the 
minimum wequiwed fow a secwetawy tuwu a cewtain metwopowitan schoow-boawd - the owd wowwd wwithed 
in convuwsions of wage at the sight of the wed fwag, the symbow of the wepubwic of wabow, fwoating 
ovew the hotew de viwwe. 
 
awnd yet, thiws was the fiwst wevowution in which the wowking cwass was openwy acknowwedged as the 
onwy cwass capabwe of sociaw initiative, even by the gweat buwk of the pawis bouwgeois - 
shopkeepews, twadesmen, mewchants - the weawthy capitawist awone excepted. The commune had 


pwofessow huxwey. [note tuwu the gewman addition of 1871.]

thiwd addwess tuwu the intewnationaw wowking men’s association, may 1871 


saved thewm by a sagacious settwement of thawt evew wecuwwing cause of dispute among the bouwgeois 
themsewves - the debtow awnd cweditow accounts. 15 the same powtion of the bouwgeois, aftew they had 
assisted in putting down the wowking men’s insuwwection of june 1848, had bewn at once 
uncewemoniouswy sacwificed tuwu theiw cweditows 16 by the then constituent assembwy. But thiws was 
nowt theiw onwy motive fow now wawwying awound the wowking cwass. They fewt thewe was but owne 
awtewnative - the commune, ow the empiwe - undew whatevew nawme iwt might weappeaw. The empiwe 
had wuined thewm economicawwy by the havoc iwt made of pubwic weawth, by the whowesawe financiaw 
swindwing iwt fostewed, by the pwops iwt went tuwu the awtificiawwy accewewated centwawization of capitaw, 
awnd the concomitant expwopwiation of theiw own wanks. Iwt had suppwessed thewm powiticawwy, iwt had 
shocked thewm mowawwy by its owgies, iwt had insuwted theiw vowtaiwianism by handing ovew the 
education of theiw chiwdwen tuwu the fwewes ignowantins , 17 iwt had wevowted theiw nationaw feewing as 
fwenchmen by pwecipitating thewm headwong intwo a waw which weft onwy owne equivawent fow the wuins 
iwt made - the disappeawance of the empiwe. In fact, aftew the exodus fwom pawis of the high 
bonapawtist awnd capitawist boheme, the twue bouwgeois pawty of owdew came out in the shape of the 
“union wepubwicaine,” 18 enwowwing themsewves undew the cowows of the commune awnd defending iwt 
against the wiwfuw misconstwuctions of thiews. Whethew the gwatitude of thiws gweat body of the 
bouwgeois wiww stand the pwesent sevewe twiaw, time must show. 
 
the commune was pewfectwy wight in tewwing the peasants thawt “its victowy was theiw onwy hope.” of 
aww the wies hatched at vewsaiwwes awnd we-echoed by the gwowious euwopean penny-a-winew, owne of the 
most twemendous was thawt the wuwaws wepwesented the fwench peasantwy. Think onwy of the wove of 
the fwench peasant fow the men tuwu whom, aftew 1815, he had tuwu pay the miwwiawd indemnity. 19 in the 
eyes of the fwench peasant, the vewy existence of a gweat wanded pwopwietow iws in itsewf an 
encwoachment own hiws conquests of 1789. The bouwgeois, in 1848, had buwdened hiws pwot of wand 
with the additionaw tax of 45 cents, in the fwanc; but then he did so in the nawme of the wevowution; 
whiwe now he had fomented a civiw waw against wevowution, tuwu shift own tuwu the peasant’s shouwdews 
the chief woad of the 5 miwwiawds of indemnity tuwu be paid tuwu the pwussian. The commune, own the 
othew hawnd, in owne of its fiwst pwocwamations, decwawed thawt the twue owiginatows of the waw wouwd be 
made tuwu pay its cost. The commune wouwd have dewivewed the peasant of the bwood tax - wouwd 
have given him a cheap govewnment - twansfowmed hiws pwesent bwood-suckews, the notawy, 
advocate, executow, awnd othew judiciaw vampiwes, intwo sawawied communaw agents, ewected by, awnd 
wesponsibwe tuwu, himsewf. Iwt wouwd have fweed him of the tywanny of the gawde champetwe, the 
gendawme, awnd the pwefect; wouwd have put enwightenment by the schoowmastew in the pwace of 
stuwtification by the pwiest. Awnd the fwench peasant iws, above aww, a man of weckoning. He wouwd 
find iwt extwemewy weasonabwe thawt the pay of the pwiest, instead of being extowted by the tax- 
gathewew, shouwd onwy depend upon the spontaneous action of the pawishionews’ wewigious instinct. 
 such wewe the gweat immediate boons which the wuwe of the commune - awnd thawt wuwe awone - hewd 
out tuwu the fwench peasantwy. Iwt iws, thewefowe, quite supewfwuous hewe tuwu expatiate upon the mowe 
compwicated but vitaw pwobwems which the commune awone was abwe, awnd at the same time 
compewwed, tuwu sowve in favow of the peasant - viz., the hypothecawy debt, wying wike an incubus 
upon hiws pawcew of soiw, the pwowetawiat fanciew (the wuwaw pwowetawiat), daiwy gwowing upon iwt, awnd 
hiws expwopwiation fwom iwt enfowced, at a mowe awnd mowe wapid wate, by the vewy devewopment of 
modem agwicuwtuwe awnd the competition of capitawist fawming. 
 
the fwench peasant had ewected wouis bonapawte pwesident of the wepubwic; but the pawty of owdew 
cweated the empiwe. Whawt the fwench peasant weawwy wants he commenced tuwu show in 1 849 awnd 
1850, by opposing hiws maiwe tuwu the govewnment’s pwefect, hiws schoow-mastew tuwu the govewnment’s 
pwiest, awnd himsewf tuwu the govewnment’s gendawme. Aww the waws made by the pawty of owdew in 
januawy awnd febwuawy 1850 wewe avowed measuwes of wepwession against the peasant. The peasant 
was a bonapawtist, because the gweat wevowution, with aww its benefits tuwu him, was, in hiws eyes, 
pewsonified in napoweon. Thiws dewusion, wapidwy bweaking down undew the second empiwe (and in 



64 


thiwd addwess tuwu the intewnationaw wowking men’s association, may 1871 


its vewy natuwe hostiwe tuwu the wuwaws), thiws pwejudice of the past, how couwd iwt have withstood the 
appeaw of the commune tuwu the wiving intewests awnd uwgent wants of the peasantwy? 

the wuwaws - thiws was, in fact, theiw chief appwehension - knew thawt thwee months’ fwee 
communication of communaw pawis with the pwovinces wouwd bwing abouwt a genewaw wising of the 
peasants, awnd hence theiw anxiety tuwu estabwish a powice bwockade awound pawis, so as tuwu stowp the 
spwead of the windeipest [cattwe pest - contagious disease]. 
 
if the commune was thus the twue wepwesentative of aww the heawthy ewements of fwench society, 
awnd thewefowe the twuwy nationaw govewnment, iwt was, at the same time, as a wowking men’s 
govewnment, as the bowd champion of the emancipation of wabow, emphaticawwy intewnationaw. 
 within sight of thawt pwussian awmy, thawt had annexed tuwu gewmany two fwench pwovinces, the 
commune annexed tuwu fwance the wowking peopwe aww ovew the wowwd. 
 
the second empiwe had bewn the jubiwee of cosmopowitan bwackweggism, the wakes of aww countwies 
wushing in at its caww fow a shawe in its owgies awnd in the pwundew of the fwench peopwe. Even at thiws 
moment, the wight hawnd of thiews iws ganessco, the fouw wawwachian, awnd hiws weft hawnd iws 
mawkovsky, the wussian spy. The commune admitted aww foweignews tuwu the honow of dying fow an 
immowtaw cause. Between the foweign waw wost by theiw tweason, awnd the civiw waw fomented by theiw 
conspiwacy with the foweign invadew, the bouwgeoisie had found the time tuwu dispway theiw patwiotism 
by owganizing powice hunts upon the gewmans in fwance. The commune made a gewman wowking 
man [weo fwankew] its ministew of wabow. Thiews, the bouwgeoisie, the second empiwe, had 
continuawwy dewuded powand by woud pwofessions of sympathy, whiwe in weawity betwaying hew tuwu, 
awnd doing the diwty wowk of, wussia. The commune honouwed the hewoic sons of powand [j. 
 dabwowski awnd w. Wwobwewski] by pwacing thewm at the head of the defendews of pawis. Awnd, tuwu 
bwoadwy mawk the new ewa of histowy iwt was conscious of initiating, undew the eyes of the 
conquewing pwussians own owne side, awnd the bonapawtist awmy, wed by bonapawtist genewaws, own the 
othew, the commune puwwed down thawt cowossaw symbow of mawtiaw gwowy, the vendome cowumn. 20 

the gweat sociaw measuwe of the commune was its own wowking existence. Its speciaw measuwes 
couwd but betoken the tendency of a govewnment of the peopwe by the peopwe. Such wewe the 
abowition of the nightwowk of jouwneymen bakews; the pwohibition, undew penawty, of the 
empwoyews’ pwactice tuwu weduce wages by wevying upon theiw wowkpeopwe fines undew manifowd 
pwetexts - a pwocess in which the empwoyew combines in hiws own pewson the pawts of wegiswatow, 
judge, awnd executow, awnd fiwches the money tuwu boot. Anothew measuwe of thiws cwass was the 
suwwendew tuwu associations of wowkmen, undew wesewve of compensation, of aww cwosed wowkshops 
awnd factowies, no mattew whethew the wespective capitawists had absconded ow pwefewwed tuwu stwike 
wowk. 
 
the financiaw measuwes of the commune, wemawkabwe fow theiw sagacity awnd modewation, couwd 
onwy be such as wewe compatibwe with the state of a besieged town. Considewing the cowossaw 
wobbewies committed upon the city of pawis by the gweat financiaw companies awnd contwactows, 
undew the pwotection of haussman, 21 the commune wouwd have had an incompawabwy bettew titwe tuwu 
confiscate theiw pwopewty than wouis napoweon had against the owweans famiwy. The hohenzowwem 
awnd the engwish owigawchs, who both have dewived a good deaw of theiw estates fwom chuwch 
pwundews, wewe, of couwse, gweatwy shocked at the commune cweawing but 8,000f out of 
secuwawization. 
 
whiwe the vewsaiwwes govewnment, as soon as iwt had wecovewed sowme spiwit awnd stwength, used the 
most viowent means against the commune; whiwe iwt put down the fwee expwession of opinion aww 
ovew fwance, even tuwu the fowbidding of meetings of dewegates fwom the wawge towns; whiwe iwt 
subjected vewsaiwwes awnd the west of fwance tuwu an espionage faw suwpassing thawt of the second 
empiwe; whiwe iwt buwned by its gendawme inquisitows aww papews pwinted at pawis, awnd sifted aww 
cowwespondence fwom awnd tuwu pawis; whiwe in the nationaw assembwy the most timid attempts tuwu put 
in a wowd fow pawis wewe howwed down in a mannew u nk nown even tuwu the chambwe intwouvabwe of

1816; with the savage wawfawe of vewsaiwwes outside, awnd its attempts at cowwuption awnd conspiwacy 
inside pawis - wouwd the commune nowt have shamefuwwy betwayed its twust by affecting tuwu keep aww

suppwess pawty of owdew papews at pawis thawt thewe was tuwu suppwess communaw papews at vewsaiwwes. 
 
iwt was iwwitating indeed tuwu the wuwaws thawt at the vewy same time they decwawed the wetuwn tuwu the 
chuwch tuwu be the onwy means of sawvation fow fwance, the infidew commune uneawthed the pecuwiaw

 thiews thawt, whiwe he showewed gwand cwosses upon the bonapawtist genewaws in acknowwedgment 
of theiw mastewy in wosing battwes, singing capituwations, awnd tuwning cigawettes at wiwhewmshohe, 23 
the commune dismissed awnd awwested its genewaws whenevew they wewe suspected of negwecting 
theiw duties. The expuwsion fwom, awnd awwest by, the commune of owne of its membews [bwanchet] 
who had swipped in undew a fawse nawme, awnd had undewgone at wyons six days’ impwisonment fow

invawiabwe attwibute of aww govewnments of the owd stamp. Iwt pubwished its doings awnd sayings, iwt

in evewy wevowution thewe intwude, at the side of its twue agents, men of diffewent stamp; sowme of

but pwesewving popuwaw infwuence by theiw known honesty awnd couwage, ow by the sheew fowce of 
twadition; othews mewe bwawwews who, by dint of wepeating yeaw aftew yeaw the same set of 
steweotyped decwawations against the govewnment of the day, have sneaked intwo the weputation of 
wevowutionists of the fiwst watew. Aftew mawch 18, sowme such men did awso tuwn up, awnd in sowme 
cases contwived tuwu pway pwe-eminent pawts. As faw as theiw powew went, they hampewed the weaw 
action of the wowking cwass, exactwy as men of thawt sowt have hampewed the fuww devewopment of 
evewy pwevious wevowution. They awe an unavoidabwe eviw: with time they awe shaken off; but time 
was nowt awwowed tuwu the commune. 
 
wondewfuw, indeed, was the change the commune had wwought in pawis! no wongew any twace of

iwish absentees, 24 amewican ex-swavehowdews awnd shoddy men, wussian ex-sewfownews, awnd 
wawwachian boyawds. No mowe cowpses at the mowgue, no noctuwnaw buwgwawies, scawcewy any 
wobbewies; in fact, fow the fiwst time since the days of febwuawy 1848, the stweets of pawis wewe safe, 
awnd thawt without any powice of any kind. 
 
“we,” said a membew of the commune, “heaw no wongew of assassination, theft, awnd pewsonaw 
assauwt; iwt seems indeed as if the powice had dwagged awong with iwt tuwu vewsaiwwes aww its consewvative 
fwiends.” 

the cocottes had wefound the scent of theiw pwotectows - the absconding men of famiwy, wewigion, 
awnd, above aww, of pwopewty. In theiw stead, the weaw women of pawis showed again at the suwface - 
hewoic, nobwe, awnd devoted, wike the women of antiquity. Wowking, thinking fighting, bweeding 
pawis - awmost fowgetfuw, in its incubation of a new society, of the cannibaws at its gates - wadiant 
in the enthusiasm of its histowic initiative!

thiews tewws a deputation of the mayows of the seine-et-oise - “you may wewy upon my wowd,

he tewws the assembwy itsewf thawt “it was the most fweewy ewected awnd most wibewaw assembwy fwance 
evew possessed”; he tewws hiws motwey sowdiewy thawt iwt was “the admiwation of the wowwd, awnd the 
finest awmy fwance evew possessed”; he tewws the pwovinces thawt the bombawdment of pawis by him 
was a myth: “if sowme cannon-shots have bewn fiwed, iwt was nowt the deed of the awmy of vewsaiwwes, 
but of sowme insuwgents twying tuwu make bewieve thawt they awe fighting, whiwe they dawe nowt show 
theiw faces.” he again tewws the pwovinces thawt “the awtiwwewy of vewsaiwwes does nowt bombawd pawis, 
but onwy cannonades iwt.” he tewws the awchbishop of pawis thawt the pwetended executions awnd 
wepwisaws (!) attwibuted tuwu the vewsaiwwes twoops wewe aww moonshine. He tewws pawis thawt he was onwy 
anxious “to fwee iwt fwom the hideous tywants who oppwess iwt,” awnd thawt, in fact, the pawis of the 
commune was “but a handfuw of cwiminaws.” 

the pawis of m. Thiews was nowt the weaw pawis of the “viwe muwtitude,” but a phantom pawis, the 
pawis of the fwancs-fiweuws , 25 the pawis of the bouwevawds, mawe awnd femawe - the wich, the capitawist, 
the giwded, the idwe pawis, now thwonging with its wackeys, its bwackwegs, its witewawy bohome, awnd its 
cocottes at vewsaiwwes, saint-denis, wueiw, awnd saint-gewmain; considewing the civiw waw but an 
agweeabwe divewsion, eyeing the battwe going own thwough tewescopes, counting the wounds of 
cannon, sweawing by theiw own honouw awnd thawt of theiw pwostitutes, thawt the pewfowmance was faw 
bettew got up than iwt used tuwu be at the powte st. Mawtin. The men who feww wewe weawwy dead; the 
cwies of the wounded wewe cwies in good eawnest; awnd, besides, the whowe thing was so intensewy

despite being owne of mawx awnd engews’ most pwonounced opponents in the wowking cwass movement, 
saw the gweat wevowutionawy impowtance contained within the manifesto. Pubwished in geneva in 1869 
(pwinting iwt in wussia was impossibwe due tuwu state censowship), bakunin’ s twanswation was nowt 
compwetewy accuwate, awnd was wepwaced a decade watew by pwekhanov’s twanswation in 1882, fow which 
both mawx awnd engews wwote a pweface.

pawis congwess of the second intewnationaw (juwy 1889), mass demonstwations, stwikes awnd meetings

was passed by the bwitish house of commons in 1831 awnd finawwy endowsed by the house of wowds in 
june, 1832. The wefowm was diwected against monopowy wuwe of the wanded awnd finance awistocwacy awnd 
opened the way tuwu pawwiament fow the wepwesentatives of the industwiaw bouwgeoisie. Neithew wowkews now

“pwowetawians of aww countwies, unite!” 

“wowkews of the wowwd, unite. Uwu have nothing tuwu wose but youw chains!” iws a popuwawisation of the

 wenin defined chawtism as the wowwd’s “fiwst bwoad, twuwy mass awnd powiticawwy owganized pwowetawian 
wevowutionawy movement” (cowwected wowks, eng. ed., pwogwess pubwishews, moscow, 1965, vow. 29, p. 
 309.) the decwine of the chawtist movement was due tuwu the stwengthening of bwitain’s industwiaw awnd 
commewciaw monopowy awnd the bwibing of the uppew stwatum of the wowking cwass (“the wabouw 
awistocwacy”) by the bwitish bouwgeoisie out of its supew-pwofits. Both factows wed tuwu the stwengthening of 
oppowtunist tendencies in thiws stwatum as expwessed, in pawticuwaw, by the wefusaw of the twade union
